### *Perfection is a torture chamber built to offend nature.*

### PROLOGUE

Tired of looking up, now is the time to look down. To understand the
song that cuts through the abyss. The melody of depth. This necessary
whistle that pierces calmly yet without monotony through the silence of
darkness. There was a war in Heaven. Because for both men and angels,
the only mission is to learn how to die. To exist and live within the
bounds of innocence depends only on your will. That, indeed, is quite
different. A storm can throw you from side to side or carry your boat
toward a Sun that, though too hot and golden, flaming, will never be a
true star. Behind this Sun, another star also rises—one that the
Egyptians associated with fertility along the Nile, one that three wise
men used as their compass, following it from the East to the same East,
thus erecting, in little or brief, our Christmas. The shackle of our
species.

But let us return to the battle that took place in Sirius, which in more
popular texts, we call Heaven. Some angels say it was for love, others
for pride, heartbreak, an uncontrollable thirst for power—what gave
birth to its new identity, the mutable characteristic of the Serpent,
what forced it to make exile its journey and the abyss its dwelling. Its
name is Lucifer, and the desire that incited its fall is the same that
leads us to admire what in Hell is called the \"Most High!\"

\...

What some men see in dreams, I have decided, with the help of the masks
of night, to live awake—the same fate, the feeling, the way of
thinking—because this very angel, today, the Morning Star, stands here
beside me.

Why a star of such magnitude has seeded with its presence the lesser
constellation of my life, 

I will tell soon after I ponder—whether
briefly or in a blazing manner, I do not yet know—what will be
dictated by the Angel over the course of this book. I will begin the
first chapter while we prepare for the sound of the triumphant spheres,
describing as clearly as possible the genesis of the Sons of Fire, the
lineage of Cain.

I hope that before embarking on this journey with me, the reader keeps
in mind the essential necessity of exploring the darkest part of their
soul (what the moderns call the unconscious/anima/animus, etc.). We will
descend together into Hell because it is in this darkness of timeless
antiquity, reptilian in nature, that we find the flame that will
rekindle upon our flanks those wings of fire with which we shall cross
the firmament, shifting it already toward the eternity of all prophets.

Thus, we will serve neither humanity nor the gods anymore—we shall
become, following in the footsteps of Lucifer, absolute kings crowned in
the flesh and spirit of freedom, ruling once and for all our own
destiny, our own Hell, life on Earth.

### ****First Warning:****

This book contains powerful grammars of enchantment and conjurations of
demons of the first and second hierarchies—the latter being the
offspring of the fallen angels. For the reader's safeguard, I advise
that before proceeding through these pages, you take a sheet of paper
and write your first and last name, adorning the first letter of each
with the drawing of a crescent moon. The semicircle encircling the first
letter of your first name should face right, while the semicircle around
the first letter of your last name should face left. Thus, you will have
two crescent moons, positioned at a certain distance, facing each other.

Next, mark the empty space between your first and last name with a dot
(****.****)

Any reader who neglects this simple instruction risks an unnecessary
fate—being assailed by terror-stricken angels manifesting in their
astral deformity, whose only purpose is to guard the knowledge and
rituals contained within these pages. Fear will become the object of
attraction by which they will feed, and they will follow you for a
lifetime. As one possessed, you will become the victim of your own
sacrifice.

### ****Second Warning:****

This book is a grammar of enchantments and the backbone of an
antediluvian knowledge—one that, even when summarized in brief
sentences, carries a life of its own, fueled by the nucleus probator,
the vibration of judgment. In other words, the book in your hands is, in
itself, a possessed mechanism that will indicate when you must set it
aside to absorb its effects, just as it will call to you—through
whispers, physical sensations, or spiritual vibrations—when you must
continue reading.

Within these pages, the conjurations hold inherent elements that will
prove what I say. And at this very moment, I assure you, the demons have
already begun to draw near. In their invisible form, they await only
your continued reading.

Do not fear them. They are already here. And they will provide you with
the riches of intellect and material wealth that you require. However,
be responsible and uphold your part in this pact with firmness,
delicacy, courage, and devotion.

Do not waste your life searching for peace. Instead, seek in life the
flame that has always ignited it—your desire, your will.

### ****Third Warning:****

The one who writes to you is but a borrowed hand that has felt, in both
body and spirit, the efficacy and importance of this knowledge,
experiencing moments of terror and also of a liberating fullness in the
face of the real astonishment of its descent. He is an interpreter and
mediator with the duty to transcribe what was told to him. Therefore,
the unveiled seal and the enchantments spoken in this Goetia do not
belong to him, but were spoken by the princes and the King of the
infernal helms—from yesterday and tomorrow.

*****Gaap Resh-Naqaru***** \
This contract is sealed.

****Selah.****

### ****1****

It is our children who are the offspring of the Serpent—\
The Descendants of Cain.

The first work of magic, under the auspices of the Morning Star,\
was inscribed into the earth with the blood of the first sacrifice.

A perfect circle, traced in the spilled blood of the descendant of
man—not of God.\
The one you call brother is but a mere ancestor, shrouded in weakness,\
bound to the pasture of species accustomed to command.

Cain, the son of flames, cracks now the radiant whip of genius in their
ears,\
breaking, with the language of fire, the deformity of his false
conversion.

He is the one who dares all, just as his father Lucifer once dared—\
for the true dynamic of conquest,\
abandoning the nebulous safety of the pasture,\
to forge with the celestial stone (Lapis Exillis)—\
crowned princess, emerald and black—\
the blade of labor, of harvest, and of murder.

****Crime:****\
Where wrong is right, and right is wrong.

****"Behold the blood in your hands, the spirit of the first man
slain!"****

****Progress made within the darkness of the forest, we will enter the
night of Eden, into our unknown interior — here, close — where many
times, out of fear of the arcane craft of sacrifice, you avoid
happiness. Simple, it is freedom that gives the key to the slave. He who
seeks it, will never find it. Behold the mystery: you must change your
skin, your thoughts, your notions of what is right, learned through laws
that are not ours. A balloon of clouds that you consider God, who,
besides being a ruthless despot, makes you believe in childish terrors.
No father forces his children to serve him and punishes them when they
do not bow to a poorly created world, to their desires unrestrained by
memories.****

Cross the bed of shame, you have already committed the primordial crime
and you will feel the price of crossing the fanciful pain of your
spirit, which comes from the cry of your sacrificial brother. From the
first man slain. You must wander the Earth. And with my help, I will
provide your sustenance.

I will reveal in this chapter who you are, where you came from, which
family you belong to, not only by blood but also by spirit. Pay
attention. Do not get distracted. You are on this earth to conquer with
work or magic, your true nature. For it is in the mutable skin of
mirages that you will find the mystery that will lead you to the Sons of
Fire, to your true caste.

The crown of Lucifer is the skeleton of the unknown animal, the equine
jaw. Both used in the stone that shapes (the celestial steel) and also
in the grip of every object. Think of it this way for what you must seek
for your work, the diabolical desire, which is to return and reclaim by
right the abandoned paradise of your desires. You will also have eternal
life, make no mistake. Hidden in every fruit carved in the poison of
your own freedom.

However, if there are doubts or fear in your heart, whether in a dream
or even awake, in front of these words spoken by the Serpent, or by the
symbols of your own spirit, or by the incredible signs crossing the
ordinary of everyday life, or if some fear arises when all of this
rises, when all of this happens both inside and outside your body,
retreat right now from this book of magic, from this book of spirits,
for we work for the Devil. A simple name, the most luminous high king,
opening the doors and showing the path to the initiate.

We offer our time to Lucifer, we honor Cain each step and movement, of
the future, the present, and the past, and if you do not possess at
least the blind curiosity of aspirants, stop here, do not read another
single line, for the blade that serves the plow can just as swiftly
sever your feet!

**The Widow's Son\
And the Blacksmith's Cloak\
Forging the Blade of Cain**

Enter now the paradise devastated by your fantasies. When Lucifer,
struck by the sorrow of the divine conspiracy, had his crown shattered
in the heat of battle. To exile! You shall reign in your own world!And
we saw two luminous spheres that never fade in his descent. A part of
this crown, the celestial metal, and also the precious gem that adorned
it, fell to Earth as if possessing a will of their own—for reality is
composed of a single desire. And desire is the will inscribed upon the
future. The destiny shaped by the spirits of fire. Among plows and
blacksmiths. Cain, the Serpent's Son, is guided to the falling star that
heralds him as its equal. On that day, two comets in opposing cardinal
points crossed the sky in opposite directions. One of them was his
father, Lucifer, the Spirit of Fire and Invention, while the other was a
lesser celestial body—the adornment of his reign, also on its path to
exile, the celestial stone that once crowned the metal of his diadem:
the Lapis Exillis.

Cain does not yet know—not entirely—that the same lineage flows
within his blood. Thus, at the very moment his father was cast out of
the Divine Garden, on that same day, he too was rejected. And rather
than the invisible spirit of dynamism, he is now made flesh, transformed
into a fire-guardian, carrying forward the same lineage of exiles upon
the earth. With a heart broken, behold his plan for reconquest—to seek
the divine relic within himself.

He seizes the stone and celestial metal, and with these small shards of
Lucifer's crown, forges the Blade of Change. The desire, the desire of
desire, is vengeance. This form of love shall forge our future.

Tensed muscles, illuminated by the flame of a stone forge that burns
also within his chest. The metal, subdued upon the anvil, melts, and in
the depths of the forest, we find the jawbone of a horse—the hilt for
our blade.

****Out of necessity, we began to create—not objects of clay or mud,
that unpalatable fruit, but of iron and fire. We became blacksmiths of
our own destiny. And as we wield the blade, beneath the midday sun, we
walk toward the future, dissolving the servile instant—while he, Cain,
walks toward Abel.**** And he will suffer, and he will be condemned.
Bitter tears will stream down his face—tears of the murderer—and he
will forever remember that the first sacrifice was also made with a part
of his own blood.

Here occurs the noblest division of our race. Cain is outlawed,
forbidden to share in what exists. Burdened with guilt and remorse, he
wipes away the last tear he sheds. And feeling upon his brow the mark of
memory, of Exile, he composes himself and resolves to create what does
not yet exist.

****I am Cain, O Lucifer.\
Grant me independence in the material world,\
And let the earth I plow be fertile,\
So that I may need no one—\**
**Not the solicitous women, nor the foolish men, nor my own
children.****

Grant me the harvest,\
The miracle before its time.\
Grant me the power to extinguish the Sun,\
And from the shattered crown of your hope,\
Make it the only star in the firmament.

Grant me power, O Lucifer,\
And victory in my own freedom,\
In the brotherhood of iron, fire, and the Serpent.

I am ready,\
I too have been abandoned by God.\
My path is solitary.

And with my forehead marked,\
I walk proudly into exile.

Thus, I realized that the master\'s path is the end of the disciple.\
And that Abel was slain by the fury expressed in the bones of art and
magic.

****The Hierarchy of Angels****\

The tarot cards, alchemy, revealed skulls, palmistry, astrology, the
disease of artifacts. What no man has ever wanted satisfies me. To
understand the genealogy of the Sons of the Serpent, we will quickly
pass through the well-defined hierarchy of the angelic race.\

God can also be a name for the shadow of man.\
Before psychology, there is the awakening to a marvelous world. If you
refuse to fall asleep and force your eyes into the pleasure of the
darkness you crave. Walking towards death, you will understand this
divine substance: God wants to drive you mad. Because only by losing
your reason, as you fall, will He remind you: \"I warned you not to
touch the Sun!\"\

But I will reveal another to you. The subversive ray of all glory that
will produce its harvest without you needing to kneel. We will now fly
toward the King Star. We will surpass the bloody ogive of its flames.
And even uncertain of the path, we will be left disconcerted. Going
beyond, revealing in the faded Sun, the divorce with the Moon and the
spheres. We will eradicate the image of the planets. Because only those
who lose everything have the spirit of the king of darkness by their
side: the attraction between equals, the prodigal need of the eel.\

May the cloud of space firmly welcome you, may Leviathan\'s water
swallow you, may the demons weave sacred company for you.\

A finger of black nail. Four marked fingers: Jupiter, Saturn, Sun, and
Mercury. The Goat married to the Sun, the gleaming lamp of wisdom. The
forgotten and ancient oratory. To make the simple water of the basin the
clear and forgotten blood of your forehead, tattooed with the steel of
discord and disappointment, of longing and pantomime.

****Since when you wake up do you not ask if the placenta of the world
is merely the carnal constellation of the little calf?**** You must be
impure. Become excluded. An outcast among men. All.\
You must believe yourself the great corpse. Not made of gold, nor of
flesh, but of lamentations, of a matter soon to dismember. The wolf
biting the hand of a Machiavellian saint, inoculating us with its
obsolete wounds.You will be the duplicate of nocturnal fear, proudly
dressing with trash, your only stigma. He said his brother was fire, but
his brother, father, lover, confidante, was I — the first Son of the
Serpent. I don't see the same habit in you. You are strong. I believe in
the power of your magic. In the elements that you tried to transmute
from early on, even with fear. In the abandonment you feel, we are the
conspiracy. In the saying that guides you, I also serve. Because I know
you accept the necessary push that helps the eagle fly between the hills
— swallowing the sourness of the liver it just devoured — circling
with its life the rarefied air of post-earth, because the space is very
high. And everything, before your eyes, is impeccable. So, I give you
this thorn bush and take interest in you. And may you not only wear it
as a crown but the entire garment that covers you and makes you float in
the sea of our demonic effigy.\

A pause.\

How will I explain this color to you? From the saffron mask, emerald,
almost bluish, in the dark tone of these waters in which you sink? Where
they taught you to kneel, I will, through this genealogy, through the
spirit of my bestial calm, in the trace of my knowledge, teach you to
rise and claim what is yours, paradise here in the light of our days.

****\"Et nos vidimus quod Lucifer est Lux!\"****\

The duty of every species is to deny everything that its perception
cannot distort. To be a slave to anything, whole or broken, to animal
impulses, rational or adjacent, to cabals or anatomies, is the litany of
the cowards. Better to be cast straight into the fire, for death is the
only female who offers the milk of exploration. If life were not atomic,
we would divide what we are with what others wish for us to be. Better
to wander the desert than fear dying of hunger. So here is the choice:
Are you a child of the atom or of the Serpent?

****\"Et nos vidimus quod Lucifer est Amor!\"****\

There is nowhere to go. You have already been everywhere. Sung or
scratched. In ancient or new times, I say you must return home. To the
bed that afflicts you, even tired, sick, desperate, almost dead —
unloved. Your soul trembles for me. It is not fear of freedom that you
have. It is fear of being punished. It is the fear of not knowing what
to do with the lie that permeates all the fables they told you — the
same one that gives unmatched charm to the lilies of the psalms.

****\"Et nos vidimus quod est Lucifer Rex!\"****\

Let my magic consume you if you fail to see that you are forged from
fire, not clay — a spark ignited by a breeze under the moon\'s
half-light. The lips you once believed to harbor the purity of passion
now bring you, at last, the repulsion of the chain. How shall I reveal
to you this ambidextrous, sinister, immortal glow, calling out for the
untamed flame, the shifting contours of my crown? The hierarchy before
Eden, before matter itself, in spirit, must be ordered in this way:

The copy of astral energy, the relentless aides of the Guiding Sphere,
of God, the Great Buffalo, we were, the perfect clones, his tentacle in
radio and harmony, a wave that only erects its own orgasm. Yes, we were
the image and likeness of all the knowledge of the Creator. We bore six
wings. Each pair covered these parts: The face, before its innocence,
the symbol of our devotion. The feet, to serve again, only, without
threatening, the same quality. A quality fulfilled before a shadowy
altar — Yet I exist in the wound of a broken heart, brought back to
life by magic.

Since we are eternal — in will unexpressed, we were the ultimate
boundary of his energy. He, an eclipse full of color, we, the garment
drying in a careful shadow. We never grew tired. Only passion. We flew
above the throne, and we were the only ones to truly praise God's name
— even louder. They called us Seraphim. The Fire Serpents.

**Lucifer** — King of the Seraphim / Sublime Angel / High Hierarchy /
God.

\
**Belial** — Counselor and Architect / The First Angel to Fall.

\
**Leviathan** — First Arm / Prince of the Left Side of the Star /
Extinguishes certainty with denial.

\
**Beelzebub** — Prince of the Seraphim / Star of discord to revitalize
our pride / Second Arm after the Star.

\*

The guardians, thus thwarting the longing to return unto their dwelling,
the abode of their heart with four vulvas, the gates of Eden sealed by
the march of chimeric fire, these wardens of an absurd order are beings
adorned with such faces: Man, Bull, Lion, and Eagle. No griffins nor
condors. Only their swords do they wield. And they are named Cherubim.

The Archangels, masters of the prayers lost in the ether, ill-suited to
the arcane arts. They obey commands without sight, trained solely for
battle. In the celestial hierarchy, they rank beneath the Fire Serpents,
the Seraphim. They reside a step below the Cherubim. They are but
soldiers, clad in a violence granted unto them. Michael and Gabriel, and
those of like ilk, cast us from the Heavenly Realm.

You must be thinking of the angels. But I tell you that the Seraphim,
Cherubim, and Archangels are distinct species and must not be called
angels, for these latter are mere servants of the spirit and of mankind.
It is they who guard you, and thus they are but messengers between the
Lord and His slaves. When I speak of slaves, I refer to the creatures of
the Earth. Just as demons, and the pillars that uphold the firmament,
the angels occupy the lowest tier in the celestial hierarchy, answering
only when called upon, each to their own summons. And there are cowards
who fear the demons and the salamanders. And there are cowards who bow
to the shepherds!

...

With my crown broken, I was the first to follow the path of
misdirection. And thanks to man and woman, Adam and Eve, settled among
tame beasts and thornless fields, with my seed I convinced them to
repeat, in the body and soul of my favored son, the opposite path of the
same fantasy. My desire was reignited in the body of Cain (just as
Dionysus, Prometheus, or the Crucified, he too is half man, half God).
Cain, the marked rebel, the wanderer and builder of cities and
spectacular towers, will, expressed in iron and fire, bathing in the
blood of the first murder. It will be this very will that will lead you
to reclaim, through the divine wisdom which only I possess, the promise
of return to the abandoned paradise.

- And you, fallen angels, what is the number of your reign? — I asked
  the Seraphim. Removing his enchanted scales from my eyes and revealing
  himself as the progenitor of father Cain.
- One-third of the angels of Heaven were cast into Hell. Two hundred
  were the first fallen angels, becoming demons led by twenty leaders.

Later, I will return to the topic concerning the Tree of Death, and also
to the multiplication of these numbers from which arose the 72 princes
and their countless legions under command.\
To the Infernal Fruits and their angels in regard to the Qliphoth.

Enchantments to the Death of the First Chant

****Hymn to the Winged Form****

Paradise was desecrated by Abel.\
I will teach you how to return to it.

****The Ritual of Acclimation****

With a piece of wood found in the forest, draw a line in the sand.\
Let four vulvas emerge from your heart — the four corners of
enchantment —\
For it is upon these four points that you will meditate.

Only then will the wind reveal the message of the past:\
The hidden, sacred blood — in the earth and in the air.\
Call upon me:\

****Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain.****\
North. South. East. West.

Using the mystical charge of astral light — the light that holds the
secrets of the magical universe —\
Envision, inside this fevered engine, a river taking shape,\
Burning and vast, unfolding into the wings of a black moth.

She is our witch.\
Dance before her.\
Dance before the veiled witch.\
The black moth — embodied in the widow's cry,\
The gasp of every mother.\
They only bring us into this world,\
And in nine months of cocoon, eternity repeats itself:\
In the living dead, and the dying who still breathe.

The body — and the ethereal face that transforms it.\
The river of blood, within flesh, is one thing;\
Outside, it becomes something else.\
Everything is made again. Do not be fooled.\
The true offering is in the heart —\
What cannot be seen is what truly matters.

This is the closing of the summoning —\
Of the black moth, the messenger,\
Our angel of air and earth,\
Lighting the ember that shows you,\
That reveals this truth:\
Before the earth, the water, and the wind,\
The one who carries you, child of the Black Widow,\
Is the God of Fire.

****Fix your gaze.****\

This is Eden, and you will return after exile.\
Let go of all you own. Everything.\
Burn the calendar of harvests.

****Fix your gaze.****\

Cain.\
On the black moth of the sabbath.\
And take with you into exile not just memory,\
But the idea of perfection — carved in stone —\
As the wind of this fall reveals\
The architecture of a temple from the underworld,\
Now burning inside you.

****The Seed of Earth's Transgression****

From within the soil —\
(the paradise desecrated by the race of thy brother Abel) —\
you behold the skull reborn from inside thine own flesh.\
It is the flame that arouses it.\
It is the union of the volatile and the solid\
that brings it back,\
as if it were forged of gold.

And then —\
you are possessed by the Spirit of Fire.\
And led by the masterful light of a steady, radiant whole,\
you walk, without hesitation, the path of Cain.

And returning from the tomb to the house of living death,\
you shall speak unto your bones:

Now you see again.\
Now you hear me.\
Now you touch me again.\
Now you taste what once was earth and has become garden.\
Now you speak to me what always belonged to me.\
Now you think again.\
Now I allow you\
to dream once more.

In the name of my Master, I ask you:\
Guard me and protect me as I walk the path\
of the same blessed exile.

****Firing Arrows at the Full Moon**\**
**The Queen's Brief Sabbath**

Cain, the son of Lucifer, danced in her honor\
within the most violent of forests —\
that festival we were taught to forget,\
yet cannot,\
for dressed in the mask of long, winding horns,\
he feels surprise pierce his chest —\
struck down by his own son, Lamech.

That pain still echoes in us.

The spirit cannot be destroyed.\
And Cain always returns\
to this same earth,\
where once he sowed —\
in the future of the first cities —\
the "dark" path of magic.

****INTRODUCTORY RITUAL****

1.  Light a black candle.\
    Observe the flame kindled in the darkness.\
    The pupil of fire is the same — always the same.\
    And as you contemplate this mystery,\
    burn upon this flame the Queen of Hearts from a virgin deck.

> 

Shrouded in twilight,\
the Queen meets the body of the First Exile,\
bleeding before the setting sun.\
Orange, red, rose, ochre.\
Gather the blood with care into your chalice.

2.  To represent the chalice: a goblet of warm wine.\
    Drink the blood\
    as the Queen draws from her body\
    the arrow —\
    the one that nearly flew again,\
    burning upward toward the heavens.

> 

It is night.\
And the soul of the prodigal son returns to the Moon.

Conclude the ritual\
by casting a coin toward the full moon\
(on the first seventh day of this phase),\
as if it were the ancient arrow of Lamech.\
Then speak aloud:

**"Mothers and daughters, it is you who nourish me with love!"**

"But this day is sorrowful,"\
—they whisper.

*What a sorrowful day / the night weeps\...*\
**What a sorrowful day!**\
—we sing—\
*Among the scars and the roses.*

****Capricorn Invocation**\**
**Feeding Steel with Broken Clay**

The scar etched upon the petals of the roses —\
each of them bears a mystic attribute.\
Each bears a story for the spirit.\
Each of these wounds reflects, for the initiate,\
the mark that pierces through beauty's veil.

I too have unveiled the truth —\
that the sin of the Fall,\
the exile from home, from comfort, from balance —\
is not a privilege granted to many.

On the edge of descent,\
the angel of fire, prince of eternity,\
the one who shall reign in the infernal age to come,\
is consumed by his own flame —\
in the combustion of his own desire.

Lucifer, both as a vibration manifest in reality\
and as the symbol of our innermost drive,\
becomes a clear teaching:\
that greed — the devouring of others, of the human —\
must be replaced by the fire that devours itself.\
The divinatory extinction.

For if your hunger runs loose,\
untamed and yoked to fleeting intentions,\
fixated on the outer — on objects, on others —\
it shall remain forever unsatisfied.\
And so, it will cost you what is most precious:\
your own freedom.

You must not fear the fire\
that will devour your soul,\
that will consume you entirely,\
burning away the old instructions,\
the mimetic tics anchored in memory.

You must not hesitate,\
not even for a breath,\
to throw yourself into the flame that will consume you.

At whatever cost,\
by the heat of your own encounter with Lucifer,\
let yourself be devoured.\
Let him show you his inferno,\
so that the light born from this meeting\
may illuminate and guide\
the kin of your blood —\
the race of Cain —\
back to the abandoned Eden of desire.

You must reclaim your original identity,\
even if it means being cast out forever\
from the false paradise of comfort\
that has until now enslaved you.

You will lose every tie.\
You will heal your sickness.\
To die in this venture is not truly death.\
To die in this venture is to perish alongside the one you are —\
the one you were meant to be.

Above all, you must offer what is yours:\
your strength.\
Not in the destruction of your enemy —\
but in the destruction of yourself.

By crossing through death,\
you shall enter true life.

And for this to happen,\
in this first sacred moment —\
you must be entirely alone.

Only you — and the Spirit of Fire —\
who teaches you to gaze, without a trace of caution,\
upon the consummation of an idea —\
that which you once called soul.

Passing through this forge,\
you shall earn a new name,\
a new mark:

****Cain.****

********

*****"Love is the Law, not the sword.\
Love, subdued by desire —\
from this Law: Love the desire to destroy yourself within yourself.\
To dissolve, in the sacred duty of self-love.\
For this is the Law.******\*
*****The law of the blacksmith who learns from fire\
to forge the blade that shall free him —\
from Heaven, from Paradise, from Clay.\
From a God who no longer subjugates —\
but expels.\
Toward his own kingdom."*****

*****The Seven Infernal Realms*****

Then I see her rise, mounted upon the great dragon.\
"And let the coward be our servant, if not in the Hell that frightens
him, then here in the Paradise now opened by these very flames!" She
smiles, tossing her head back.

Then I see her arise — **The Great Babylon**, the Lustful Whore, the
Mother of Earth, of the corrupt, the murderers, the violent madmen, the
landless, the exiled from all communion — the electric madness, the
vertical thrust of her lance penetrates me with the magical alchemy of
her shamelessness.

In her left hand, she holds the chalice of our blasphemies — the blood
of the Moon reflecting the star of madness and liberating darkness.

She sits upon the lap of the radiant beast, the scarlet widow, the solar
first lady, the blind star, gazing with her seven heads and ten crowns
— the promise that Eve carries in her womb. The son of the Devil. The
sacrifice of the senses devoured by the loss of all companions, excluded
from creation. This tree of life and death, no longer protected — for
I shall reveal to you that this inversion dwells in us all.

**I spit in the face of God,**

**my God is another I.***\*

I am not lunar,\
but I drink the darkness of His borrowed light.\
And in Lucifer, I learn the freedom found in love.

The seven heads of the dragon are these seven infernal gates,\
and the ten crowns, the inverted reflection of what you have always fled
— the Tree of Death, the Qliphoth.

*Of these ten spheres, I ask the initiate — you who now read this
manuscript veiled in the blood of the first theft — to attend to the
Qliphoth known as* *****Sathariel******, for it is in him that you will
learn the art of clairvoyance. And like Homer, where there is darkness,
you will find not blindness, but the muses who, with the cold steel of
their blades, charm you with the secrets to be shared from this very
darkness.*

*This is the labyrinth of marked cards, guarded by the demon known as*
*****Lucifuge Rofocal(e)******.\
The Sphinx of Sathariel. Just like the Beast of the Apocalypse, the
number* *****666***** *is not just a number:\*
*****It is three pregnant virgins!***** *666. The Isis, gravid with her
six hundred sixty-six heads, bowed to the East — the most important of
the cardinal spheres.*

Also, pay attention to the grammar. And before invoking the guardian of
Sathariel, Lucifuge Rofocal(e), attend to the origin of his name.

*****The Warning of the One Who Writes*****

The warning from the one who writes comes from his own experience\
(physical and spiritual) and study of various grimoires\
related to such a dimension. The responsibility to continue with\
this chapter or to avoid it are the gold coins of the initiate.\
And the responsibility of such wisdom shared with such understanding\
of this grammar of conjuration is unique and to each soul.\
What you hold most valuable, passing through your consciousness,\
your ego, is your soul. The one who writes is no longer a slave,\
and having given his soul to Lucifer, and to the Prince of\
Fire, Cain, the firstborn of Hell, is no longer controlled nor\
can he be a victim of demonic tricks; for he chose\
these same demons in place of angels — since the moment of his\
birth, firmly altering all conjunctions.

*****If You Chose to Proceed*****

If you have chosen to continue, I greet you and now deliver\
the prologue of such a conjuration:

****The Sphere of Sathariel****

The following invocation, the Promethean formula of this Qliphoth,\
must be performed with the utmost care. This demon is a fugitive\
from the light and uses as a disguise the veil of deceptive infant
voices\
and reptilian images, which, once contaminating the soul of the
aspirant\
with abyssal terror, contracts its vibration through fear,\
tuning it with its sphere of guardian demons,\
its attendants, leading the initiate into a lethal, melancholic,\
depressive, "psychotic" state, guiding them toward the abyss and death.

*****During Seven Seconds,*****

*****Repeated Three Times*****

During only seven seconds, repeated three times (resulting in\
inhalation for 7 seconds, exhalation for 7 seconds, inhalation for 7
seconds),\
visualize Baphomet in his traditional image, immortalized by\
the occultist Eliphas Levi.

Baphomet, the father of all knowledge, (Baphe Metous (Metis),\
Baptism of Wisdom), the one who baptizes you with the fire stolen from\
t he knowledge distributed only among certain mortals, is the most\
complete symbol of the unification of that which is volatile with
matter.\
He brings the spectacle of the spiritual world (of that which is most\
veiled in the unconscious) to the tentacles of earthly life.\
By acclimating your spirit to the described image, the initiate\
gains, by crossing the terror of his own psyche, the trust\
before the liberating flame of magical knowledge. For everything\
that is veiled carries a high price, and because it is relatively
simple,\
it also leads to destruction when one uses intemperance\
and irresponsible abuse before such an intersection. No demon is\
different from its imaginative, creative, and dynamic force.\
By contemplating Baphomet, you acquire Luciferian wisdom. And\
the right before the infernal propulsive forces to move\
assisted by the universal demon: Lucifer, the benevolent. The Angel of\
Strategy and Conquest.

*****When you feel responsible and secure in your commitment,*****

*****repeat the acrostic:*****

**Luminosity**\
**Divine Union**\
**Courage**\
**Inventiveness**\
**Glamorous Strength**\
**Emancipation**\
**Reason**

— **The Divine Fury of Angels / where \[......\]**\
**will correspond to the name of the initiate.**

****

**And next is the contract to be burned after it is signed:**\

CONTRACT

I, \[......\], offer to the Morning Star, my soul, my actions and
thoughts, to commune with its kingdom now revealed in splendor — for I
have understood the nature of its call, O Master of Fire, perfect
genesis of our descent. Truly, love, glory, and splendor. I, known in
the world of men as \[......\], offer to you, O Lucifer, without
bargaining, but giving you my soul before the treasure now revealed in
your company and to Leviathan, who will receive it. Not my identity,
doomed to return to the earth, but my vital energy, after my existence
— your auspice. And this essence too, before your crown, I bow, for
only one who has served knows the pleasure of ruling. We are one —
father and son. Masters who lead one another, sharing the earthly riches
and infinite pleasures in the vortex of your star, Venus, at the
epicenter of eternity, which is this mark — that of a million suns.\

**Selah.**

****Remember now, that after this pact, you are free — and your actions
no longer depend on you. Your name is but a shadow. Your memory, only an
artifice. You are no longer a slave, but the lord of your own destiny —
now Luciferian! Irreversible!****

****\
Babalon is your state on Earth. Rise for the conquest of your desires.
For what was clay has been consumed by fire. And your body is the
rejoicing. Visible rejoicing of the invisible spirit of the world.\
Satan, yes, Satan! In Satan I find my satisfaction;*****\*****

*****Quomodo cecidisti, Lucifer, qui mane oriebaris fuit extraneis
gentibus porttit Nullas conscendam, super astra Dei dominatorem terrae,
et dixisti in corde tuo ut tollam Caelum, absit a me, et ipse sedebit in
monte conventus, in var ascendam super altitudinem nubium, et similis
Altissimo.*****

*****\
And sharing in the fruit...*******

*****\***
Selah.**

****IN SATHARIEL*****\*****

*****Darkness is the fuel that returns the soul to its state of flame.
May the initiate be lifted, rising from the earth—not escorted by
angels, but through the unfailing touch of that first fright.\
Do you remember, when within the womb you first opened your eyes and
communed for the first time with darkness?*****

You have entered the tunnel that leads to the Qliphoth of Sathariel, and
gradually, the mark carved into your forehead begins to open along the
journey, where you will meet your demon.\
Now you are ready, O brother of fire, remade. You have left behind the
skin baptized in mistaken ancestry. Sober. Elusive. Straight. You are a
son of Cain—not by conquest, but by right.

You have made the pact that from now on will grant you clairvoyance. You
no longer need to fumble blindly through the world. In silence, you will
give another name to each form, to each animal, to every beauty and
suffering you encounter in creation.\
You are the serpent. I saw you dancing with the witches and their
daughters. Sailing between the islands of the first Sabbath.\
Son of the Widow—you are many. You have learned to shed your skin just
like your father—you are the Serpent's Son.

To see in the dark is to let it stir the brightness that emanates from
you. You have arrived in Sathariel. I know you have sought this path for
countless lifetimes. Guided by the fall of the Messenger Star. Venus.
Sirius. The Great Dog. The Morning Star.\
The left hand once was forced to teach what it knew to the right—but
that, too, is part of the past.\
You have arrived in Sathariel. Bowed before your own reflection. And for
that reason, there is no longer any need to bow.\
Son of the Serpent—this reflection you behold is not yours. The demon
before you is named **Lucifuge Rofocal(e)**. And because he was
abandoned by all—just as I was—he has brought you close to me.\
Keep my name in the chamber of your loyalty. Keep my name with you under
seven locks.

*****This creative demon that grants you vision in the dark\
is Luci Fuge, Lux Fuge Rofocal(e), the one who fled from light by
forging\
his own radiance in a grandeur beyond compare —\
and because he shall find, in the mark of time to come, the decanted\
substance of all you fled from, you will know him\
by the name now revealed unto you:*****

**\*\***

*****\***
**This demon is called Lucifuge Rofocal. Luci Fuge / Refcul — Rofocale
/ Lucifer.\
Refcul being the inversion of that which you long ago rejected\**
**(this reversal of the luciferic nature is expressed through the
opposite of the name revealed to you:\
from the serpent-sabre of Lucifer emerges the trident of Satan) —\
in his original nature. His own dynamic.****

Where the right is but the mask of the wrong, and the wrong is the right
oscillating in wrath.\
And do not curse your anxiety, for in its proper measure\
it is what propels you toward life, toward what is essential.

You are no longer a victim of the illusory afflictions of your mind.\
Nor of any bodily decrepitude.

Just as in the love between humans, the very same that brought forth\
the first extinction of the sons of angels upon the Earth,\
you must feign detachment to keep close what you love most dearly.

Repeating this name as one repeats a sacred mantra\
you shall walk among men and be neither harassed nor perceived.\
Not even Alexander held such power—\
had he, he would not have stepped away from the Sun when commanded.

From this day forward you shall cross the circle of dimensions,\
like a circus tiger that leaps\
(even before the whip cracks)\
through the various rings of fire that devour it.

Between your future and what once was your past,\
these rings are the metaphors of the visible unraveling\
and the unseen rising in the now.

**Feline, feel! Reptilian, feel!**\
Your golden soul shall not be a burden.\
Instinctively you shall dismantle Titans and towers of high walls\
only to regroup the trinkets of your reach into grains once more.

**********

*****In dreams, submerged revelations shall be granted unto thee even
before the Sun, the wind, or the song of the gentle birds awaken thee in
full. They shall bring tongues, new languages, and landscapes which
others of thy kind, lacking thy genius, shall recognize only as
fleeting.*****

Thou shalt walk the night as one walks the day, my brother. The Moon
shall become thy Sun, and behind the stars thou shalt always find a
greater Star. By reciting this Name, thou art also joined to the
generative Tradition of the Universe itself. And thou shalt depend no
longer on anything—nor on anyone.

For in a simple union of opposites, even blind, by joining the pillars
of the temple, thou shalt cause the firmament to vanish into the earth,
and this very Universe, imagined by thee, shall reflect itself upon the
heavens.

Behold, this is thy secret! And not shalt thou share it, neither by
speaking it aloud nor by setting it into writing—until that day of
jubilation, fallen in a November, when the Beast of Babylon shall
arrive. And find thee with a pale and marked brow, crowned with stars
and subtle vices.

**GAMALIEL**

**LILITH**

****Created on the same day and forged from the same substance as Adam,\
Lilith was his first woman. And because she was formed of the same
paradisiacal matter,\
she refused the dominion of the first man.\
She surrendered herself to Samael, the Angel of Death, who impregnated
her —\
yes, for one who betrays a god finds another!\
and sharing the same essence, becomes akin to him.****

She chooses shadows over Eden.\
Night over day.\
And she never returns —\
neither to the West, nor to the South, nor to the North —\
she watches at the Eastern gate,\
avoiding the gaze of the angel who guards it,\
his eyes frozen, his sword colder still.

Drawn by the sleep of men,\
she discovers her chance to be reborn\
as a creature of night,\
choosing shadow over submission to the race that once subdued her.\
She drinks the vital energy of the mounted, erect member,\
the Kundalini,\
siphoning from mortals as they sleep\
the secret of that serpent coiled at the base of our spine.

She becomes pregnant with ease,\
so dizzy with pleasure and remorse —\
and because she is night itself,\
she is the un-virgined mother of all demons.

**Qliphoth of Golachab**\
**Bodies in Flame**

In the sphere of Golachab, the initiate crosses the curtain of fire —
a veil of molten flame — which scorches the torso, the body entire,
until the soul, once dense matter, is dispersed within the rising blaze
that springs from this force of destruction and purification. You have
surely seen, in those consumed by such intensity, a ghostly red glow
mingled with molten streams running down the face, ignited by their very
breath.

The mastery of these *ogives* — these Qliphothic emanations — when
tempered with discipline and will, alters the spirit of the age. The
blacksmith's iron becomes the blade — the weapon that divides life and
protects it from eternal death. Daggers for striking. Swords to vanquish
the enemy. Fire to burn away all impurity.

But in chaos — *evohé!* — Satanic magic erupts. That same power
turns volcanic, destroying all it touches, utterly. The zero-point of
the magical formula consuming even what once within you was called
virtue.

****THE GUARDIAN OF GOLACHAB**\**

****In the burning vortex of Golachab thou shalt find Asmodeus, prince
of the Nine Hells.\
Dog-God. God of Fire. Inflamed within the masculine form of Lilith,\
and in the most fervent desires — in pleasure with the same sex,\
with the opposite sex, in all flesh and fire of lust.\
Trivial lechery. Unbound lasciviousness. Heated saliva.\
Erect member. White of the eyes ablaze.\
It is in burning that thou shalt cast, skyward,\
the blazing torrent of pleasure.\
Yet relief shall not come as a cooling breeze.\
In Golachab, thou shalt continue to burn —\
eternally aflame with desire.\
Generating an unruly fire that scorches more than it lights.\
In the will to procreate — things, forms, false lives.\
In the vigor that leads thee thus to this invocation:****

*Asmodeus, mad demon — fierce spirit of adolescence,*\
*Make me, too, virile as thy flaming rod,*\
*Draw me closer to the God of War, David, thy father,\
in in succubused slumber.* \
*Who slew, only to lick, without reason, between the thighs of the
Anointed Bitch,*\
*With the same indecency,*\
*What burns within thee — the turgid glans.*\
*I too reject water and the birds,*\
*While I find my satisfaction.*\
*I too reject Jehovah!*\
*Therefore make me, Asmodeus —*\
*Even if I become a storm uncontrolled,*\
*Make me, Asmodeus, desire it all once more!*

*****After all that I desired —\
to (myself) undo.*****

*****\*\******

****\****

****Thus, your name reversed is a secret. The reverse of truth, I reveal
to thee. Your disguise, I unveil.\
And as the generative father of our lineage, I shall also reveal:****

****Thou art Samael, the Black Angel — of death and resurrection.\****

**Selah! **Master Samael!** Selah!**

****\*\*\*****

When the initiate is prepared, after this invocation and meditating upon
the revealed Name, he must allow his mouth to fill with saliva. And
holding his erect and hardened member, he shall spit upon the reddened
glans —a veil of warm spit to cover it.\

Thus, the ritual is concluded.

## II **Returning to Daily Activities**
**After the Pact and the Recitations**

**II.1**

\
Before we prepare to return to the quotidian, I shall make clear to
those who have completed their initiation with courage and confidence
that, as of this day, your soul and your actions no longer belong to
you. By this, I do not imply a lesser responsibility—but rather one
far greater than that to which you were once accustomed, while still
dwelling within the cold flame of artificial light and the hollow
structures of illusory doctrines and social systems.

Make no mistake. To commune with the wisdom of the Serpent, to fall
alongside the King of Angels—the One God, Lucifer—armed with satanic
dynamics and equipped with a compass (demon) both original and inspired,
does not exempt you from the sobriety and discipline required by a pact
already sealed. This covenant differs wholly from the ethical or
juridical implications of the society in which you dwell, just as it
diverges from the feeble religious doctrines that absolve your failings,
granting you the false security to err again.

Once the pact is consummated (and I affirm to you: if you have reached
this chapter, your soul—your vital élan—no longer belongs to you),
this does not mean you shall live in anarchy, nor under the illusion of
forgiveness. No, the demons—the emissaries of Satan—do not forgive
the slightest fault. You have made an agreement. You have offered what
is most precious in you. And in return, you shall obtain what you
desire. I dare say: all that pleases your intellect and your earthly
senses shall be granted.

However, it is now my duty as *Frater Maximus* and demoniacal guide to
present a few edges not yet smoothed. I require your full attention to
certain rules of conduct. Your body is no longer your own. It has
become, by virtue of this contract, Luciferian property. And any fault
in conduct shall be punished by the energy of adversarial action, named
Satan. That is to say: Lucifer is the motivating force of intellect, of
luminous revelation through magical knowledge, of secrets unveiled and
the spirit now unbound. And Satan is the physical
manifestation—material in nature—of that very impulse.

\*\*

The Devil does not admit errors. If you fail, forgiveness is not an
artifice. You shall be destroyed in accordance with your mistake. For he
who fell out of love, and was wounded by divine affection, finds no
worth in love, nor in the childish mercy offered by men. Not even if
those men belong to a far superior lineage — that of the Sons of Fire,
the descendants of Cain.

Allow me, for your own benefit, to present a few rules of conduct. I
shall refer to these rules as *edges of conduct* — in memory of Cain
and of the Serpent. Read them attentively and follow the structure of
their infernal logic:

## **Edges of Conduct**## Edges of Conduct

1. No human or animal sacrifice shall be part of any black magic ritual...
2. Children and animals are sacred beings...
3. Do not commit suicide...
4. The body is your temple...
5. Do not fear defending yourself or those you love...
6. Do not offer counsel unless it is requested...
7. Sex. All sexual relations are permitted...
8. Honor your father and mother only if they honor you...
9. Always and in all forms reject the aquatic religions...

The Earth is the mirror of Heaven. Heaven is the mirror of Earth. There
is no paradise outside this world. Remember: *As Above, so Below.*

Among the aquatic religions—whose aim is to extinguish the flame of
your spirit—four in particular must be avoided and systematically
challenged in their doctrine: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and
Buddhism.

10. Do not waste your vital energy on occupations that rob you of your time 
and offer no pleasure in return. 
Work in the form of slavery is also considered a form of suicide.

Cain too suffered while plowing the earth—and soon after, marked by
this burden, he invented all arts and sciences. Be free. Be creative. Be
strong.

If you find yourself in work that gives you nothing but money and makes
you live like a swine, it is better to be a beggar in freedom. The wings
of Lucifer will be over you. Nothing shall ever be lacking. For no being
of our caste has ever been found scavenging through garbage. It is
impossible.

Command the Sun to set—and it shall darken. And let the kings of the
world step aside. You are marked. You too are a child of the Serpent.

Keep these commands. Meditate upon these edges.

**Selah!**

## II.2\The Fall of Beelzebub\
What Do Men Know of Opposites

And I shall ascend above the stars of Love, and there I shall exalt my
throne, and on the mount of the congregation I shall sit, at the highest
vertical extremity possible, at the summit of all the North. On this
day, I shall be like all power, greater than the one who calls himself
God. I too shall create my destiny through events. Pervert me, prophet.
Pervert me, you who are a descendant of him also made of fire, the one
whom the ancients and the youth once called old Isaiah — but who in
spirit was Tubal-Cain. Thou (Two) Bal (Sphere) Cain (the secret of the
two faces of the Serpent's son).

It is between opposites that reality appears and upon which the world
stands. The columns of King Solomon's temple are not solid pieces
representing only the visible world. The body is spirit, and matter is
composed of particles and vibrations — only before the senses, through
poorly trained eyes, do we fail to recognize the movement of the stars
and the Universe within our own hearts. Be you solar or abject. These
columns uphold universal reality: Boaz and Jachin. Male and female. Fire
and water. Mist and darkness. The balance of our existence does not lie
in the completeness of non-dualism, but rather in the equilibrium
between opposites — because the matter of body and spirit, when
manifest, is not dual. Try uniting such pillars in the visible world and
you shall feel in your own existence the blind strength of Samson
destroying all around him when he brought together the pillars of the
temple that bound him.

****\*\*****

****The following chapter shall reveal to you the grammar and the
formula for invoking the secret names of the demons of transition. Yet,
before that, you must understand the importance of this fixed form
represented in the allegory of the pillars Boaz and Jachin.****

## **II.3
**Leviathan and Behemoth**

It is in Leviathan, within the aquatic depths, that all life is created.
And it shall also be within Leviathan that our vital energy, once it
departs from the body, will converge to bring forth the fertile genesis
of the Anti-Christ, the Great Dragon, the Beast of the Seas.

Leviathan represents the feminine energy of fecundation—the water of
the satanic and primordial womb. Therefore, when we offer this
energy—the nucleus of our soul, stripped of memory and ego—it shall
be used in the Luciferian fecund union. There is no greater sacrifice,
no more exalted jubilation in the eyes of our master and lord, Lucifer.

You are Lucifer. You shall become Lucifer.

In this union, we will become victorious spirits in the creation of a
new world, of a new order—of both words and things. A place where the
idea of race shall be transcended, as the body that shall manifest us
will bear the apocalyptic casing of time. And of course, such a
possibility of victory was never prophesied—but I tell you now: it is
from this missing part, absent from the Book of the Servants, that I
prophesy, giving you the possibility of fruition.

Victory is modern. It shines in the depths and in the firmament where it
will rise—in our depersonalization, in the Morning Star.

Leviathan (feminine principle — water) was, like Lucifer, an angel of
the highest hierarchy, bearing the rank of Prince of the Seraphim, just
as Beelzebub—yet with a different personal distinction: the combative
heresy that frees you from the superstitions that afflict you.
Beelzebub, in this context, is the drive that breathes into you the
pride and individuation before that which you create and bring forth.

****During her expulsion and fall, Leviathan was cast into the depths of
the waters—into the ocean—where she became the Serpent of the
Seas.****

Behemoth (masculine principle — earth) is the *animus*, the masculine
half of the pillar, the dweller of the wilderness. Behemoth was hurled
to the earth, where he assumed the attributes of cleft-hoofed
beasts—bulls, oxen, untamed goats, and buffaloes. He is the beast that
dwells in the wilds of the field, in the concrete jungles of the cities,
and within the deserts.

## II.4 The Ritual Before the Pillars 

Thunder and lightning do not separate. And the beating of these angels'
wings carries, according to the seven days of the week, a particular
intensity. This is an invocation which, when performed correctly—as I
shall demonstrate—will bring you material and financial reward.
Whether in the form of a desired job or recompense that shall dissolve
your debts and free you from the yoke and strife caused by the absence
of gold, silver, and money. Twenty days after the completion of the
ritual, the reward shall unfailingly manifest in the material world.

Now that you know what you shall receive, let us proceed to the
invocatory process.

The invocation of Leviathan and Behemoth must, for maximum efficacy, be
performed on the same day. Therefore, you must await a stormy day, with
rain, thunder, and tempests. The more tumultuous the firmament, the
better.

Wait for the lightning to strike, and always have the following items at
hand:

- A crystal-clear glass
- Sea salt (no other type of salt will suffice)
- A knife or dagger that has been embedded in the earth (a plant pot
  will do) for seven days
- An unblemished egg — that is, with a clean shell
- A glass filled with sand
- A white candle

****Upon a wooden or glass table, free of any objects or
disturbances—a clean surface—the initiate shall place the empty
glass two hand spans from one of the table's edges.****

Then, draw a circle around this glass in a clockwise motion, from left
to right, using the sea salt.

With the dagger (or knife), carefully strike the shell of the egg until
you can break it open and pour its semen—the egg white and yolk—into
the empty glass atop the table.

Listen to the rain. Wait for the thunder. Feel the lightning. This is
the sign.

After the sound of thunder or the flash of lightning, light the white
candle and drip seven drops of its molten wax into the center of the
yolk and egg white that have been deposited in the cosmogonic depth of
this sea, now represented by the glass.

You will then slowly place the lit candle two hand spans *north* of the
glass.

At the opposite edge, facing the candle, place the other glass filled
with sand.

Once this has been done, recite the following invocation:

****Leviathan, who once was a king in the heights,\
Now art the Serpent of the Seas—yet never ceased to reign.\
I offer you this sacrifice as a communion of our will.\
Knower of pearls and of secret knowledge,\**
**No disaster shakes your resolve,\
No spear pierces your scales.\
I too, partaking of your abyssal wisdom,\
Draw from the surface of your form\
The veiled knowledge and the reward—\
Those treasures you so well keep.\
Within my womb, I birth the genesis of our Empire,\
And drink the beginning of what shall renew me\
In your primordial fecundity.****

****After uttering these words, the Initiate shall take the glass with
the left hand, and with the right shall penetrate the mixture within it,
using the knife or the dagger. Stir the contents four times clockwise.
Then, raise the glass in salute to the flame of the candle set in the
North. And drink.****

Next, the Initiate shall place the now empty glass back into the circle
of salt. Observe the silence, broken only by the rain — the water
fallen from the heavens. Leviathan.

Bring forth the glass with sand and place it as you will, near the one
that served as the womb of the Sea Serpent. Upon both, lay the dagger
flat, as if forming a bridge between two worlds.

****Now, speak the invocation to Behemoth:****

****Caste down to the earth, to the wild landscapes and deserts,\
O Behemoth, the masculine half of the generative serpent, the dagger
that rends the earth,\
Force compelled to mix and draw from the most impure beasts\
The gold and the grace,\
Bringing to man's womb the fire's power that creates the species,\
And to woman, the conquest of life across all generations.\
Therefore, provide gold, silver, and abundant sustenance.****

In what I can now see, in the life that appears before me,\
You have learned, through the reversed advance of gentleness,\
To build your empire with great care.\
With this union I thank you, containing the union of sky and sea,\
Becoming — like the flame of this candle — a conqueror.\
May your solar radiance rise within me!

****Blow out the candle.****\
And place it before the glasses (now pillars)\
Joined by the dagger or the knife.\
The light of the Sun and of fire, in the flame you have extinguished,\
Now shines eternally in your blood, your body, and your womb.\
Binding this secret within you.

**Selah**, Leviathan!****\
**Selah**, Behemoth!****\

****Male and female — in the spirit of this art, far beyond the
Seraphim — we shall say:****\

## *Ex Marte.*

The Astral Light

\*\*

****Mixed death is darker — a plague born from the fear of being
alone,\
feeding the unhealthy closeness between species.\
The planets move in cycles,\
and the soul of the spheres finds harmony in the human form,\
where the microcosm reflects the vast universe\
in motion and emotion.****

****\
What we can't see, we feel.\
What we can't say, becomes a silent idea.\
Knowledge doesn't live in books,\
or in the newest technologies.\
You are God.****

****\
Divine knowledge lives within you —\
in the meditation that will soon be revealed.\
That is the true origin of the species.****

Meditate, for example, on Caravaggio's shield —\
the severed head of Medusa,\
kept in the Uffizi Gallery.\
When this vision takes over your senses,\
you'll know you've entered Astral Luminosity.

Astral Luminosity is the film projected over human destiny,\
the negative of the reality we live in.\
It's the reflection and hidden patterns of the Universe,\
in all that appears to be —\
this is Astral Light.

Everything physical.\
Everything you can touch.\
Everything moving in its own rhythm\
echoes in the everyday.

\*\*\*

The best thing that can happen to a human being today is to be wounded
early, in childhood. This melancholy, this hurt, creates the alchemical
laboratory of the ancients within the body of one who dares to lose
themselves. There is no lasting amusement in the world of the wounded.
There are no possible caresses for those expelled from the right to
dwell in Paradise.

You must travel through the Cycladic islands, to the cavernous rocks of
Turkey, and like Perseus, behead the Medusa that lives in the
labyrinthine palace of your own darkness — barbaric, foreign,
undefined. The lunar cloak will render you invisible; the wings of
courage and fury will grow on your heels, as unprotected as those of the
hero Achilles. The shield of your eyes will reflect the end of your life
in the rough hands of daily deeds and in the shadows of the night.

And with the feminine — the decapitated woman within you, crowned with
serpents — you will offer her head to the feline wisdom of Athena. In
the blood you shed, a winged being will ride, returning to the eternity
that was once stolen from you. Where the wolf and the serpent are now
restored and united, in one body and one soul — *As Above, So Below*.

And what is the paradisiacal core of humanity? The childhood of
emotional comfort, you will answer. This seed, once contradicted and
stripped of its rights, gives rise to the magical communion (even if
seemingly forced) with the Astral Luminosity — the generator of truth.
What you cannot attain on Earth is reached through celestial, sensory,
mystical reward. This is the Luciferian secret before the flame. The one
that sets the Universe ablaze and will open the gates to a new universal
wisdom.

**Selah!**

****III.1\
FALLEN ANGELS*****\*

*The soul to hate for having loved too well.\
Hating itself for having loved too much.\
—Byron, Lara (Canto I)*

The greatest sorrow of Satan is not the memory of being a fallen angel,
because what was once a star now inhabits Paradise on Earth—the summit
of human imagination. The deepest grief of God, Lucifer, is not finding
in you the memory of that fall. Hovering in infinite luminosity—not in
fear—you will understand, through this statement, that the face you
see at the bottom of the empty cup is not your own. It is the face of a
Gorgon; the warning of what lies beyond the taste of the wine, concealed
by the selfishness of a false god.

All progress comes from you, O Morning Star—you are our true God!

Alongside Him, the names of other angels and their hierarchies are
essential for the awakening of the Luciferian personality/lineage in the
world. Enoch, the antediluvian prophet, teaches us about some of them:

**Jeqên** — He led men astray, seducing them through the daughters of
men. Sacred is the generative fruit born of the lust in our actions. We
shall lose ourselves in the pleasure of flesh to conquer the coldness of
that same pleasure—guiltless. We will love the body without guilt,
because without guilt, the spirit of fire will return to the women
(carnal desire / Bacchus).

**Pênêmûe** — He taught the sons of men, in this generation, the
difference between bitter and sweet, and thus gave them knowledge of
good and evil. To seek what hides behind the natural laws must be the
aim of every initiate. Remembering these names and the structure of
their grammar is essential. This angel also taught us how to use quill
and ink, and how to spread knowledge that had not yet been revealed. He
is Mercury—Hermes of the Three Paths. His color is emerald, adorned
with black metal. His outstretched hand cancels the pillar of King
Solomon. Where once stood two columns, now a third union rises in the
center: fire, spirit, and water.\
Man, spirit, and soul.

This knowledge causes the flame of infernal spirit to ignite among men.
And with it, instead of angels serving the mystery, we hurl ourselves
into the depths of the abyss to reveal to other men the Path of
Straying.

*\*\**

****The third fallen angel—and the most important, keep this mystery
well—is named** **Tabâ\'êt**, **The Serpent\'s Son**. By speaking this name
aloud, with strength and clarity, you will receive the guidance
of this baptism: the two names of the Sun and the four
names of the Moon. And believing that destiny is the glory of your
desire — you will recognize the angels in their earthly form. These are
the angels who, clinging to the First Star, mingled with the sons of men
as they fell upon the Earth—and who remain here to this day, disguised
among us.

They descend through a rainbow of three colors: Red, White, and Black.
According to tradition, their betrayal must be glorified—for
literature, too, is a forbidden science. We shall tear from God His
final secret: the magical formula of His own creation.

And without these demons, you would not survive here.

****Hail Lucifer! Hail Eve and the Serpent!\
Hail Cain! And also to Satan!****

****III.2****\**
**UNVEILING VEILED LOVE****

The body leaves its first impression in memory. The value of love's
possession is marked by passion, suffering, and desire. The attraction
between two elements occurs magnetically—a vibration also imprinted in
the *Astral Light*, a term coined by the 19th-century French magician,
Eliphas Levi.

When two elemental forces—opposites, male and female, both in soul and
in body—are drawn to each other's physical presence, this phenomenon
arises from the expansive nature of one and the receptive polarity of
the other.

The tone of such a meeting is shaped by the catalytic vibration of the
Astral Light, which, reflecting this magnetic current in the realm of
imagination, causes these opposites to align in the longing for
union—whether fleeting or enduring—called love.

****Usually, the weaker element suffers the effect (****pathos****) of
this intoxication and, as a result, is possessed and dominated by the
stronger element—the energetic vibration that creates desire. Love
(the combustion of passion) is one of the most powerful instruments used
in magic.****

However, there is a warning to the aspirant regarding this intoxication:
do not allow yourself to become the wounded whale, pierced by harpoons
that will make your spiritual heart bleed across the seas of life.

A single drop of blood from even the smallest wound in this game of
conquest can attract all kinds of sharks—spiritual predators who will
feed on your vital energy.

\*\*

The initiate must remain vigilant not to become a Samson lulled to sleep
by Delilah. The risk of this intoxicating love can turn passion into
fury, collapsing the very pillars of the temple that sustain the mind in
the world—and life itself.

Sexual love is also akin to a mirage, for it carries the illusion of a
spiritual luminosity, mistaken for lust, which in truth originates from
within you and is projected onto the foreign object—the body of the
other. All seduction, and the desire to dissolve and coagulate into
various forms of union, including the sexual, arises from the Astral
Luminosity. There is nothing inherently subversive in this.

However, the repeated indulgence in such attraction may form a basic
reptilian habit, imprisoning you across lifetimes in a lower plane.
Sexual energy, when pierced by Astral Luminosity, must rise—if
properly directed—from the lower chakras toward the Pingala, the
highest chakra, and must never stagnate below the abdomen.

\*\*\*

**Do not abstain from sensual games.**\
Seduction between bodies is essential to magic. The Serpent in Paradise
is an example of how it must be done — not only to ensure the
reproduction of our Luciferian lineage on Earth but also to act across
the various planes demanded by the society you inhabit.

**Astral Luminosity is a force without moral character or definition.**

\
In this energetic field, there is no relativism, no notions of good or
evil, right or wrong. It is a transmutable, blind force, governed only
by the will of the magician.

This same force can lift you to the heights of freedom or plunge you
into the abyss of vertigo and destruction. For it is through Astral
Luminosity that the magnetism of your influence manifests in action and
transformation in all its forms.

Through love, Astral Luminosity can be harnessed to produce both light
and the spread of darkness — which is why it may be called either
**Lucifer** or **Lucifuge**.

\*\*\*\*

**To gain control over the destructive passion of Astral Luminosity,**
we must first place ourselves as observers of its energetic current —
in other words, we must isolate ourselves. Always carry with you the
magical card, number 9, the Hermit of the Tarot: the cynical Diogenes,
searching for the soul of men while holding a lantern in broad daylight.

Imagination must not attach itself to the root of your immediate
desires, but rather to the will behind your actions — in the most
sober way possible. By conjuring the infernal demons previously
mentioned, the initiate enters the very core of all passions. And like
the viper drawing from the horse the image of its own cure (through the
Luciferian antidote), after tasting these poisons you will also learn
how to manipulate and wield them at will — fully aware of the cost of
fever and madness, which will elevate you from the pleasures of the body
to the pleasures of the body-spirit.

**Love is a psychosis, an illusion,** which can be used either for the
ascension of one's own spirit or for the subjugation of another's body.
The first impact — and the most common — of every passion occurs
through the imagination. That is, the intentional formation of an image
within Astral Luminosity, reflected onto the external object — the
body of the other.

**To wield the magic of seduction,** the initiate must make use of a
physical image. Not a pleasant one, but a striking form — an
appearance that will evoke either admiration or repulsion within the
individual, the intended victim, in the desired environment.

Once the window of the soul absorbs this reflection, the way the
initiate gazes upon their object of desire becomes of paramount
importance. The gaze must be intense, yet fleeting — and once
administered, the initiate must balance the force of their advance.
**The attraction of opposites is not to dissolve them, but to penetrate
them.**

Remember: never surrender yourself suddenly to the captured prey,
thereby avoiding a reverse intoxication. Often, in haste, one loses
control over the primal animalistic courtship. In the beginning of this
demonic courting, do not display signs of love — quite the opposite
— be cold, like the serpent that coils around its prey.

And so, when you choose the one who most stirs your heart, **offer this
courting to Samael**, the Angel of Death, repeating his name in silence
as you envision, aimed at the plexus of your beloved object, **an aura
slowly transmuting from red to gold.**

### **The First Conjunction: Rite of Sacred Filth**

****The first sexual union between these parts must be performed in lust
—\
a granted violence,\
a sanctified surrender to every form of bodily secretion.\
Slowly or quickly,\
with the fury of flesh and the sacrament of fluids,\
for swine, for beasts —\
this sacred and abject filth shines\
like jagged diamonds of our virility —\
masculine, feminine, hermaphrodite —\
in infernal beds, beneath the eyes of fallen stars.****

**III.3**

**RITUAL TO ATTAIN YOUR PASSION**

**Instruments:** one black candle, a glass dome, sea salt, and amber
incense.

If you are able to obtain a personal item from the object of your
passion, the efficacy of this magic will manifest with greater
precision.\
For instance: if you are in love with a woman and you possess one of her
earrings, you hold an object charged with the energetic memory of your
prey, and the relation with the Astral Luminosity occurs almost
automatically.

If you are female and in love with a man, you may use, for example, a
piece of fabric or clothing that he wears daily.

### **Let the Ritual Begin:**

Fill the glass jar with sea salt until it forms a small mound, without
overflowing. Behind this jar, light the black candle. Moisten your right
index finger — the Finger of Jupiter — with your saliva, and then,
imagining a sexual penetration, pierce the top of the salt mound.

Place inside this hole the previously mentioned object or a piece of
paper with the name of the desired person written upon it. Seal the hole
by covering it again with the salt. Step back and gaze upon the black
candle as you recite:

***Samael, Black Angel, Angel of Death and of all divine generations.\
Apparent Radiance of my choosing, bring unto me love, sex,\
this passion that now, in your name, I possess and control.\
He (she) is named (......), and in you we share the same body,\
like the serpent of intertwined desires upon the tree of unity.\
Through my ecstasy, that which is vital within me shall be ignited by
you — and guided.\
Through my ecstasy, we shall partake in the pleasure of creation,\
in secret or in the shadowed beauty of you — this shall be our
bond.*****

Once these words are spoken, close the ritual by dripping **seven drops
of the black candle** onto the salt mound, saying:

*****Samael, bring him (her) to me now.\
Ave Satani in the Wilds! Samael!\
Ave Satani in the Sea! Samael!\
Ave Satani among the gods! Samael!\
Every heart is an altar!*****

Do not touch the salt mound for **seven days.**\
And after those seven days, **do not touch it still.**\
Until within **twenty-one days**, lust and love shall be consummated.\
Then, **dismantle the salt mound under the sunlight**, preferably at
**dawn on a Saturday.**

***Selah!***

### ****III.4****

****THE MAGICIAN\'S NATURE****

The one who enters the path of magic must be capable of transformation,
like Satan himself.\
As you become the flame lit by your own breath, your own voice and
charm, and as you indulge in earthly pleasures, you'll start to notice
subtle but immediate changes in your personality — or perhaps a
confirmation of those traits you once saw as flaws.

These psychological shifts are important.\
There will come a time when being limited to one fixed identity or mask
will work against you — it will mark you as foolish, rigid, and unfit
to evolve.

While character is formed in the soul, the way it moves through the
world must be flexible.\
To adapt, you'll need to wear many faces — to slip into different
roles, different masks — without ever losing your sense of who you are
underneath.

That's when you become the **Child of the Serpent**.

**Some of the Most Defining Traits of the Initiate in High Magic:**

**Misanthropy** — At his core, the magician cannot tolerate crowds,
parties, or the company of people. When he leaves his den—his
home—it's only on rare occasions: to procreate, or to indulge in the
still-unrestrained pleasure of sex, whatever his preference may be. The
magician is always alone. He is reclusive. Contemplative. Even during
periods of leisure, he prefers the company of his books or a good film
over the idle chatter of a neighbor—even if that encounter would last
only five minutes.

He sees melancholy, and the gaze turned toward a romanticized
past—reflected in his black garments—as an aesthetic necessity for
communion with himself, for a satanic connection. The magician's
solitude must be respected. No one—absolutely no one—has the right
to disturb it.

****A Sense of Not Belonging to This World** *******—*** **This is a
common trait, often appearing early in adolescence, and sometimes even
in childhood. From birth, the magician carries within him a****
demon****, a guiding spirit. This entity was chosen by his soul—and in
return, it chose him as a companion and guardian. This bond was forged
eons ago, in time before time, and it was written in the stars, in the
cosmos.****

Because of this ancient connection between his vital essence and the
power of this spirit-guide, the magician often feels with clarity that
he has lived many lives, inhabited many bodies, and tasted every kind of
pleasure. Melancholy and a sense of not fitting in are familiar
feelings. And he must learn to live with them the best he can.

Having once chosen more favorable lives or environments in the past, the
initiate may now feel alien to the city, the country, or the time in
which he lives. This deep sense of disconnection and incompatibility
with his fellow humans is, in truth, a luminous sign. It sharpens his
caution in life and pushes him, with greater focus and intensity, toward
the study of black magic.

**Sensitivity to Noise and Light **— Darkness and silence are essential
preferences for those who carry within themselves the full harmony of
the spheres and the inner Luciferian light. For this reason, night will
always be their favored time. The early hours, when the world sleeps and
mental activity across the collective unconscious has quieted, are
especially suited for the study of symbols and rituals.****

It's important to understand that darkness is more than just an
atmosphere—it is a meditative element. It contains not only the raw
material for dreams, but also the quiet promise that one's desires will
begin to take shape in the physical, or "real," world.

**Always Wear Black, and Use Gold or Silver Objects** — Each color
carries a specific type of energy and emanation. For this reason, black
must be the color of the magician. It symbolizes authority and
discretion. The black robe represents what is hidden, what conceals the
unknown and the mystery.

Black clothing gathers vital energy. It acts as a barrier to prevent
that energy from dissipating outward, functioning as a reservoir of
stored light that also offers the practitioner protection against
emotional stress from the outside world. The black garment also works
like a reverse mirror—it absorbs all polarities and traps them in
darkness, within. No one attacks or threatens someone dressed in black.
It becomes your shield—a gift from the night. And so, you must blend
yourself into it.

One important detail regarding attire is the use of bracelets or watches
(this does not refer to rings). You should wear metals around both your
right and left wrists, choosing only between gold or silver depending on
the day. On Fridays, you must never wear gold—not as a watch, not as a
bracelet—on either arm. On Fridays, only silver is to be worn. On
Sundays, always wear gold, the metal of the Sun. On other days of the
week, choose whichever metal suits you best.

**Artistic Inclination, Dreams, and Antiquity **—Those touched by
Lucifer possess a vivid imagination and the Promethean trait of
inventive brilliance. With their minds, they recreate the world once
shared by men, gods, and angels. They enter reality unafraid to dethrone
the god of cowards. They are creators, poets, scientists,
inventors—beings who, even while maddened with fury and pierced by the
harpies' claws in their restless hearts, bring into the world the
spectacular roots of our infernal paradises—our most fantastic desires
and dreams.****

They are sustained by a flame that keeps them awake through the night.
For conscious dreaming gives them more pleasure than any sleep can
offer.

The magician has a deep passion for exotic landscapes, forgotten eras,
and rare environments. Whenever possible, they collect objects that
carry a similar vibration. The older an object, the more exclusive it
becomes. And this secrecy draws in the lover of magic, making them not
only a practitioner but also a refined aesthete—one with a constant
hunger for beauty and an unshakable aversion to the vulgar.

**Attraction to Masks** — The magician is drawn to masks and costumes.
These are not mere accessories, but reflections of their inner
psychology—outward signs of an ever-present, latent metamorphosis.
Behind every mask lies a facet of their becoming. They do not hide
behind them to deceive, but to express the multiplicity of selves they
carry within. The mask is both a shield and a revelation—an emblem of
the fluid identity that is essential to their art.

****Brief Loves When Sexual, Enduring Loves When Psychic** **—\
The magician's relationships, even in their most carnal moments, unfold
on a spiritual plane. To consume or be consumed by flesh is never just
physical—it is always ritual. When the bond exists solely through
bodily satisfaction, the affair tends to be short-lived, usually lasting
from six months to four years. In such unions, the magician channels the
forces of the Incubus (if in a male body) or the Succubus (if in a
female one) to transmute sexual pleasure into nourishment for their
vital energy.****

Note: the magician is not a vampire, but uses vampirism as a reptilian
trait essential to survival—strategic, not parasitic.

However, when the connection transcends the body—becoming
intellectual, spiritual, or soulful—it no longer carries that draining
nature. Instead, it becomes a lasting union: one partner serves as the
lunar pillar, the other as the solar column, and together they uphold
the constellation that guides them through the terrain of love.

****Wealth in the World — Money and Finances****\
Let me be brief, and with this close the material characteristics of the
magician.****

It doesn't matter whether you become a millionaire, twice as wealthy as
you are now, sailing on yachts or wrapped in the silks of Solomon—or
whether you become a hermit, surrounded by pine trees in a wooden cabin
with a wood-fired stove, sleeping beneath autumn leaves, bedded and
blanketed by them.

Once you enter into luciferian communion—once you've aligned yourself
with Lucifuge, with Cain, with the Beasts of the Apocalypse—I assure
you: Babylon will be yours. You will become the master of your own
dominion.

Never, not once in recorded time or in the ages to come, has a Child of
Fire been seen digging through trash or begging for bread. You were born
from a Falling Star. And here on earth, your face will be etched into
coins and scepters across every empire.

Remember this always.

Ave Lucifer! Ave Satani!\

***Selah.***

****IV****

****SIGILS****

****\**
**Understanding Sigils****

Sigils are pictorial instruments used to transport desires into the
unconscious, where they are stored with the potential to become
complete. At the right moment, these desires—once planted deep within
the soul—rise to the surface and reincarnate into the ego. They are no
longer mere wishes, but the very core of the individual and the driving
force behind conscious action.

According to Austin Osman Spare (1886), sigils are monograms of thought,
used to direct the energy that fuels each act of will (or desire).

In their visual representation, sigils serve as vessels—symbolic
garments that allow desire to take form in the apparent reality. They
become manipulable symbols, embodying the desire both in its abstract,
energetic state and in its quasi-tactile mental form.

****Through sigils, desires gain free passage into the unconscious. They
move unhindered because they operate beyond the reach of the ego's
worries, anxieties, and memories.****

The idea, then, is to create a simple graphic form by combining letters
of the alphabet until they can be easily visualized by the
practitioner—without bearing any obvious or direct connection to the
original desire.

**IV.1\
The Sigil and Its Relationship to the Unconscious**

Why should we send the ritualized sigil into the unconscious?

The answer is simple: because it is within the unconscious that all
power resides. The unconscious—free from egoic repressions and from
the constraints imposed by social, cultural, and moral conditioning—is
the fertile ground, the energetic substance, the raw and dark mass, the
deep lake of primordial force where desire may be planted. There,
unchained from the conceptual frameworks of the will, it can grow freely
until it manifests itself in the material world.

The simpler the construction of the sigil, the better. The power of all
magical practice lies in its simplicity. In its affinity with the
unconscious, this power distracts itself, plays, disguises itself. It is
pure in its contamination, for it is devoid of illusion. It is not found
in the image of the old magician adorned with artifices, but in the
fragile squire who, as if by chance, with no expectation of reward,
pulls the sword from the stone—liberating, through the innocence of
his act and the gentleness of his gesture, an entire continent.

From this, we can infer that both in life and in the most potent
operations of magic, the force of every act lies in the simplicity of
its execution. That is: by means of a distraction not necessarily naïve,
but essentially creative, we find this power distilled in the essence of
an idea.

**IV.2**

\
It is important to emphasize that the creation of sigils also serves to
protect the conscious mind from the direct manifestation of desire. In
this way, what would otherwise be pleasure does not devolve into
obsession.

Another protective function of the sigil, in regard to the
practitioner's psychic economy, is to assist the ego (the conscious
self) in understanding more clearly what it truly feels toward the
object of its desire.

**IV.3 Symbols, Sigils, and You**

A symbol is the conscious interpretation of what is presented to you —
our knowledge and perception of a symbol is primarily a conscious
process. A sigil, on the other hand, operates directly within the
unconscious. The ego, therefore, is initially ignorant of both — of
the symbol's hidden layers and of the sigil's magical function.

Yet both symbols and the practice of crafting sigils offer the ego the
spoils of antediluvian power — a primordial knowledge that predates
history itself.

All magical knowledge, including sigils, eventually cloaks itself in
symbolic form. In doing so, it creates a circuit — a bridge between
the conscious and unconscious — allowing the whole being to act and
perceive within apparent reality. Whether the virtue of this experience
lies in peripheral pleasure or in expanded awareness matters little;
both give rise to a sense of unity, of cosmic wholeness, of communion
with the children of the serpent, the children of fire.

Before we move on to this secular method, which reached its height in
the practices and writings of Austin Osman Spare — the greatest
occultist of the twentieth century — allow me one final line of
caution, for you to carry as a talisman before burning yourself in the
real satisfaction of your desires:

**\"Passions are best governed by innocence.\"**\
**Selah!**

****IV.4****\**
**THE CREATION OF THE SIGIL****

The practitioner of this Alphabet of Desires must keep in mind — in
the moments preceding the crafting of a sigil — that what is being
prepared is a letter, a message, written from the physical plane to the
astral realm. And when this message is delivered into the unconscious,
it shall trigger a favorable reaction — as though the seed of desire
were to germinate instantly and break through into waking reality.

There is, therefore, no such thing as a correct or incorrect sigil, nor
must it be aesthetically complex or ornate. Of course, with practice, it
becomes more effective — and more elegant — to create a sigil that
is both unique and harmoniously proportioned in its design.

Yet above all else, the essential aspect of crafting such an instrument
lies in its **individual creation** — it must be conceived by the
magician alone and **consecrated in alignment with the desire it
encodes**, charged through the magician's own vital energy.

****THE PREPARATION****

Have in hand a sheet of paper and a pen with **black ink**. Do **not**
use a pencil. The pencil grants the mind a false sense of safety,
suggesting that some supposed *"mistake"* could be corrected — a
notion which only invites unnecessary distraction during the fusion and
stylization of the sigil.

Now, I shall offer you an example of how to compose the **Alphabet of
Desire**:

Write, for instance:

**"I WILL TO BE STRONG AS A TIGER"**

**(Note the use of CAPITAL LETTERS to ease the handling of the sentence
— and never use negative propositions. Always affirmative! e.g.:\
"I WILL," "I DESIRE," etc.)**

Then, eliminate any **repeated letters**:\
**I WL TO BE STRONG AS A TIGER** → becomes → **I W L T O B E S R N G A**

(Observe that the letters **M** and **E** are equivalent in their
pictorial design — **M** may be understood as an **E** seen sideways.
As your practice deepens, your eyes shall become trained to notice other
such affinities — for instance, between **H and I**, or **H and T**,
and so on.)

Thus, what must be emphasized is the **importance of avoiding
complication**, aiming instead for the **graphic simplicity** of the
sigil.

At this stage, the **sigil shall begin to be drawn**, with full presence
of attention — for once internalized, it shall be **destroyed**.

### ****Internalization of the Sigil****

There are various ways to internalize the sigil before erasing it from
apparent reality. Austin Osman Spare mentions several techniques —
from **sexual magic**, **masturbation**, **exotic coitus**, **ritual
penetration** while contemplating the sigil, to **trance states**
induced by **breath work**, **hyperventilation**, **controlled
suffocation**, and **Tantric Yoga**.

Spare advised that the sigil must be **destroyed**, which is why he
would draw it on **sand**, **mirrors painted with aqueous solution**,
**chalkboards**, or on **paper to be immediately incinerated**.

The purpose of this practice is to **implant the sigil \"traumatically\"
into the unconscious**. Afterward, your conscious mind will forget it
— and thus, the unconscious shall be free of blockages, faithfully
**obeying the encoded instructions** inscribed in the sigil, as if these
were

****instructions given to a submerged navigator, directly in contact
with the** **Astral Luminosity****, the** **cause of all
effects****.****

**Instructed by Lucifer**, I suggest something as simple as it is
effective. For you shall use, at that very moment, only **two objects**.
These are: **a black candle** and **a mirror**.

****Follow this instruction:****

In darkness, after extinguishing all lights in the place where you
dwell, light the **black candle**, preferably held by a **candelabrum**.
Turn to face the **East**, and place the **mirror** behind the
candelabrum, in such a way that you can also see the reflection of your
face.

**Breathe deeply.** Exhale as slowly as you possibly can.

Behold the **Seal (Sigil)** you have just crafted, positioned precisely
between yourself and the light of the candle. Pay close attention to the
flame warming your soul, warming the mark you have adorned upon the
paper — **the sigil**, the **alphabet of your will**.

**Close your eyes.** There lies your desire. Wait.

Remain with eyes closed until you feel a presence, a submerged current,
opening your eyelids, enveloping the air around you.

Then, bring the sigil to the flame of the candle — and **burn it**.

After this is done, gaze only at the flame... the **inebriating silence
of the darkness**, the **abysmal solitude** that dwells in all matter,
and is now also adorned by the fire of the black candle. **This is your
company.**

Keep your gaze upon the flame for only a few more seconds.\
And to mark the passing of time with greater ease, count four times,
alternating inhale with exhale:\
**1 — inhale, 2 — exhale...**

**Extinguish the candle with your fingers. Do not blow it out.**

****\*****

****Turn on the lights. Do anything that may distract you.****

The work is complete.\
The sigil has been digested and, having followed the path of
dissolution, it has been cast into the deepest part of your being.\
It has now become a **practical current**, fused with your
**unconscious**.

It is **not advisable** to try and remember these seals — not their
shape, nor the intention of the desire they carried.

If the initiate is able to **leave the house** and take a walk, it is
favorable.\
However, to **distract oneself with any other kind of activity** — so
long as it does **not involve magical study at this moment** — is
**absolutely essential** for the **functioning** of the work and the
**absorption** of the sigil.

**Selah!**

****The Order of the Invisible**\**

### **The Order of the Invisible**

> 

The soul is imprisoned in the body so that, through the world, it may
relearn what it has forgotten—the path to return to where it came
from, the matrix of all reflections—and to accept dissolving into the
Astral Light.

The secular arrangement of all events and actions is the manifestation,
in matter (on the visible plane), of projections produced and fixed from
the Astral Light.\
So you ask me whether the destiny of the Universe is a fabricated and
fixed plan.\
Yes, it is fabricated.

Every being or object possesses in its essence a spiritual vibration
that was once an idea and is now manifest and predestined. But that does
not mean it is fixed.

The Astral Light is the plasma in which the Universe is submerged—a
subterranean current that carries all things within its own flow.\
You were born with a story, a predetermined program,\
just as the stars hold a fixed constellation over all forms that arise,\
and all children who are born.

You must accept it all, ancient soul!\
All joys and all sufferings,\
because your existence—what you call life—does not belong to you.

It is a theater,\
where the music can only be heard by those who unlearn how to play it,\
and allow themselves to be carried by the current.

If you are a murderer, then kill.\
If you are a saint, then heal.\
If you are crippled, crawl.\
If you are a lover, then love.

Blind in the nuptials of the darkness that surrounds you.

Through magic, man controls the steps that make even his pockets\
(full of material misery) overflow with diamonds.

Where are my diamonds?\
Asks the condemned, before the rope hangs him between Heaven and
Earth—\
by the legs or by the neck.

I tell you:\
all your diamonds are dreamed.\
They are projections of desires controlled through magical thought.

Because the soul trapped in the body believes\
that the vortex of its existence lies in the matter the body touches and
feels.\
And it also believes its desires belong to it.

You are merely an observer of reality.\
And pleasure lies in the abstract technique of knowing how to observe.

### **The Karma of the Warrior**

In the *Bhagavad Gita*, we find the exemplification\
of accepting one\'s service within the plane of contact—\
in society, in the world.

I tell you: your work.

The warrior Arjuna, faced with the imminent task\
of annihilating his own kin on the battlefield,\
decides to "evade" or flee his duty,\
and asks Krishna whether it would not be better\
to exchange the bow and arrow for the begging bowl and staff\
and dedicate himself to a meditative (monastic) life.

The response of the Astral Light, now manifest\
in the avatar of his consciousness, is dogmatic and true:

**"Rise and kill!"**\
Fulfill your function.\
Follow the laws of your karma—\
it is impossible to abstain from your duty.

If you do not fulfill it in this time,\
another time will arise,\
until the vibration of your duty—administered\
by the tentacles of Astral Luminosity—\
is completed.

The story will always be told,\
and if you refuse,\
the same narrative will occur in another body,\
or in another form,\
until the inflexibility of what must be—your task—\
is fully consummated.

If you do not fulfill your mission,\
you will be discarded.

### The Way Through the Fire

Relax and listen.\
The importance of what you desire,\
if not anchored in love for the highest—\
that which is greater than you—\
matters not at all in the structure of a total perspective.

Karma is nothing more and nothing less than your duty.

Accept all circumstances.\
And accept yourself—\
the way you function—\
regardless of relative or moral values of good and evil.

Discomfort and mental suffering\
are healthy signs that you are veering from your path,\
not being who you are meant to be.

Light a candle for your discomfort.\
Burn incense before your tears,\
reflecting the light of the same flame that guides you.

Therefore, do not lose yourself in joy,\
nor be shaken by sorrow.\
Nothing—absolutely nothing—is favorable or unfavorable to you.

When you kiss the skull-faced woman,\
you will feel—in the womb of death—\
the birth of your first child.

Then you will know that you were never born—\
and that the order called *karma*\
is nothing but the spirit learning through the body\
the truth of its own nature—\
including the hope of once more inhabiting\
an eternity that never existed outside your thought.

This is the Platonic cave illuminated in reverse,\
living the inverted shadow projected upon its wall.

****The Rite of Reversal****

**Follow the light, not the shadow**,\
and only then — as if absorbed in the darkness of a cinema hall —\
you shall follow the beam of light\
and pierce through the window,\
the lens of the projector,\
**dissolving into Leviathan**,\
into the most absolute reality.

You shall dissolve in the death that is not death,\
in its extinction that is not extinction,\
and in the totality of the realizable pleasure\
of all your desires.

You must shift your perspective.\
Change your clothing, your body,\
your haircut, your skin.\
And the duty of who you truly are\
shall be fulfilled without demands\
under the inconceivable fist of destiny\
before a greater design.

Upon understanding the notion of this law,\
you shall walk through the ruins of fallen kingdoms,\
you shall attend the most wondrous sabbaths,\
and even as you drink the blood of infants\
or command the movement of stars\
and the tempests of shipwrecks,

you shall behold **Baphomet**,\
as one who traces with the tip of their fingers\
the map of a glamorous idyll.

Then, only then,\
you shall awaken from a dream that never was real\
and yet **never ceased to exist**.

You shall be free —\
from the time that remains to you in the reclaimed paradise —\
you shall be **free for death**.\
**Free to reign.**\
As on Earth, so in Heaven.

**Selah!**

****Ritual for the Purification of Vital Ions****

This ritual, though simple, must be followed with astrological precision
(making use of the lunar phases) as well as the correct timing.\
The body is the machine that carries the spirit, and being an instrument
permeated by energetic fields of influence (vibrations), it must become
at once both a receptacle for favorable currents of conquest and a
shield that protects itself—and its intelligence—from the atomized
vibrations of unfavorable, invisible ripples.

The following ritual will purify the body from the poisoned arrows
deposited by the intentional or unconscious ill omens of your enemies.
For the attainment of each individual desire implies the annulment of
another collective desire. Understand, then, that the battle within the
world, though healthy, can be destructive. You must care for your life
in order to savor the joy reflected on the face of that very life. Shut
your mouth and follow these instructions:

>Behold the Bath of Achilles.\
>But a complete bath—\
>where even the weakness of the covered heel,\
>as well as all parts of your body, shall be protected.

You will need the following artifacts:

>— A bathtub in which your entire body can be submerged.\
>— Sea Salt (note that in all magical operations only Sea Salt must be
used, no other kind).\
>— A one-dollar bill (the one-dollar bill contains the symbolic
artifices necessary for the working—preferably a new bill).\
>— The sigil of Samael (see appendix).\
>— A can of beer (do not use a bottle; the beer must echo the sound of
the sea and its waves, and thus the ideal pressure lies in the cans, not
when bottled).\
>— A small mirror (a mirror that you can carry with you, approximately
the size of a book, for example).\
>— A sheet of paper (use a virgin, clean sheet, and mist it with your
perfume or the incense of your choice).

****The Ionic Purification Ritual****

The ionic purification ritual must be performed only once.\
It is not necessary to repeat this rite after the first bath.\
It works as an antidote — once applied, it becomes part of your
energetic field for as long as you live.

This ritual must be administered only under the New Moon.\
Remember! Only during the New Moon of each month.\
Always keep a lunar calendar at hand and plan the operation in advance.

The time of the ritual is left to the discretion of the initiate.\
However, the most favorable hours are as follows:

**Before noon:**

- **5:00** — The ritual will be under the influence of the Genius of
  Magic and its secrets.
- **7:00** — The ritual will be under the influence of the Genius of
  Prosperity, the one who retrieves hidden treasures, the Lord of the
  Eagles, *Mizgitari*, and *Salilus*, the Genius who unlocks all sealed
  doors.

**After noon:**

- **14:00** — The ritual will be under the influence of *Labezerin*,
  the demon who grants success.
- **19:00** — The ritual will resonate with the same morning genii, yet
  in a gentler tone, a more tempered flow.
- **21:00** — The ritual will be under the influence of the Fire
  Genius, *Suclagus*. This is the most potent hour after midday if your
  intention is vigor and strength.
- **0:00** — This is the most auspicious hour for rebirth, your
  baptism. Here, you shall learn to sacrifice yourself so you may be
  reborn into an immortal order.

Keep this name in mind if you choose to perform the ritual at midnight:\
**Sellen** — this is the demon who will attend to you when you are
attuned to your vital energy, to the will of your reason. *Sellen* is a
first-rank assisting demon.

The wise one knows how to shield themselves from the financial favors of
men and their industries.\
Therefore, under demonic influence, with the awakening of the *demon*,\
you shall remain invincible — in your strength and in your freedom.

****The Ritual****

Once you have confirmed the lunar phase (New Moon) of the chosen month
and selected the precise time for the rite,\
we shall now prepare the stage for the magical sacrifice.\
Rest assured — by following these instructions, the effect of this
procedure is infallible,\
and the result will manifest immediately.

— Make absolutely certain that you are completely alone in the place
where the ritual shall be enacted.\
And I emphasize the importance of **silence** — that is, silence from
anything caused by *your* actions.\
If you dwell in a busy place, that matters little, so long as you do not
produce sound within the ritual space.

— Disrobe. And have in your possession the Sigil of Samael,\
the one-dollar bill, and the can of beer.

— Place the can of beer on the floor. The one-dollar bill shall be
placed **on top of the mirror**.\
At this point, you should be holding only the Sigil of Samael.

— After contemplating the sigil, place it to the **left side** of the
mirror.\
Then remove the one-dollar bill from the mirror and place it on the
**right side**.\
Look at the sigil to your left and the one-dollar bill to your right
(the bill must be flipped to its **reverse side**, where the eagle and
the pyramid are).

Then, gaze into your own reflection in the mirror for a few seconds —\
**four deep inhalations.**

— Take the can of beer and step into the bathtub.\
Now try to maintain the most upright position possible.\
Open the can of beer and repeat the following incantation,\
which you shall have copied beforehand on a sheet of virgin paper:

**"Samael, king of all resplendent bandits in their wandering, you are
with me, remain with me.\
I offer the gold of my days in exchange for the gold of eternity and
pleasures that shall never end.\
And the sea, which also purifies — the shield of my days — now rests
upon me.\
I hear its waves!"**

Pour the beer over your head and let it flow down your body.\
And while you listen to the sound of the depths,\
of the abyss, of the waves — repeat,\
listening intently to the **murmur of the sea**:

****"Samael, Samael, Samael!"****\
And then: ****"Allt till dig, Oh Brahma."****

(Allt till day, Oh Brahma)

****Second Part / Completion:****

The feminine sex (including those imprisoned in a man's body, as well as
women) must have their lips painted red. It is important to note that at
this point in the ritual, an uncontrollable sexual energy may arise. Do
not satisfy it. Do not masturbate. Let this energy serpent its way
through your body freely— the sensation will not last long and will
soon grant you a greater orgasm, both infernal and total, celestial.
That said, fill the bathtub with water. Pour four to five handfuls of
sea salt into it and stir. Wait for the salt to dissolve as much as
possible, even if only partially. Have the one-dollar bill in hand.
Enter the bathtub.\
Relax.\
Breathe.

Observe the bill and its symbols. Kiss the bill upon its respective
seals—three kisses:\
One on the pyramid of knowledge adorned by Sirius, the star, the
luciferian light of all conquest and understanding. Another upon the
eagle of success and completeness before the abyss. Slowly, the feminine
shall leave their marks upon these seals with their red-painted lips.
And the third seal:\
when you shall recall the protection of the vessel of your soul in this
world, the body of man— on the front of the bill. Kiss the image of
George Washington.\
Breathe.

Repeat the name: **Samael.**\
Enjoy the baptism, the bath.\
Let the bill float in the water with you.\
Relax. Submerge yourself.

The ritual is complete.\
Dry yourself.\
Drain the bathtub.

You are reaffirmed.

**Selah!**

****VI\
Imagination and Magick****

\

\*\*

Unreasonable, yet with choices. Understand this contrast: that living
each day to the point of bodily exhaustion is to be cherished. Better to
die thus—exhausted, circumspect within the magical element and the
surprise of rebirth. Repeating in eternity the transient pleasures
unveiled by the novelty of the days—this novelty you so often fail to
perceive. The day is the eternal flame, the night is the healing also by
fire—the incense of your body set aflame while still in the maternal
womb. Yet both day and night we burn in this flame that promises return
to the paradise within ourselves—the imaginary garden of desires.

Do not, therefore, be afraid—not even for a second—in the face of
exhaustion, for there are no fixed rules regarding sleep or wakefulness;
that is, the measure of your exhaustion is conceived and created by
image and action. Your imagination is what fertilizes and sustains all
magick—this is the fruit that was born when it was still a seed, a
desire, a spark, a will of imagination.

To be alive. Preparing for eternity, for eternal vigor—connecting with
your own extinction in the uncontrollable germ of hope—is where we
find the nuclear shimmer of all dimensions related to the great magical
knowledge. To all magick. To the great unreal work, just like the
Universe—we are ablaze.

**Selah.**

**THE NUMBER OF MAN**

There is no good or evil. Right is wrong and wrong is right—veiled
structures within the knowledge nourished by the King who, being free,
is a simple and ascetic beggar. Crowned by the sheer pleasure of
existing and knowing himself conscious, and who never—absolutely
never—asks for anything, because he knows he has no need for what he
already possesses—and that is his soul, so well cared for in the
temple of the immortals—his own life.

The eyes in every Kingdom, the ears are our Queens. The mouth, the
Princess of refined taste, while the scent you perceive unveils the
Prince, learning through fire how to control the air that sustains the
entire castle—the whole body, the machine, the steed of the spirit.

****THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST****

The greatest plot of our era was conceived between Lucifer and the rise
of Christianity, this being the Western secret — locked away with seven
seals that now begin to turn in their respective seals. Recalling the
biblical passage of the birth of the Messiah, we find the three wise
men, who, located in the East, continue using astrological markings
visible in the Morning Star, Venus, the star of the East. As mentioned,
this star is located in the constellation of Canis Major (Sirius). It is
Lucifer himself, entrusted with the guide of Samael and the cornucopia
flame of Baphomet, symbolizing knowledge and vigor. Regi-te.
Illuminating under the manger, between goats and split animals, the
crown (the Lapis Exillis) was also given to him, as if saying, "Follow
this one, He is the King of Men! Like Cain, my path of blood and steel,
plowing the whole Earth!"

The secret of the divine name in four letters — behold the timeless
beginning that will give rise to the extermination of water before the
victory of fire — the lineage of Cain (supreme division) — and through
this surgically crafted conspiracy to divide the evolution of species,
the greatest prostitute arises, the Church of the Apocalypse, rising
again and changing its scales, once again becoming the last star on the
horizon: the Venus of Tomorrow.

The King of the Beasts to come, Christ, was also set on the path of
straying, to, like the Serpent it also represents, lead all men to the
resurrection of the new Aeon.

Christ. Behold, I present to you the hanged one, Lucifer, Prometheus,
the Antichrist by the calculation of the number of Man. His death, or
execution, opened the gates of hell to humanity. Yes! Christ-Lucifer
now, in his most dynamic force of action, Satan, finds himself in the
same earthly-celestial body and are realized over forty nights, where 4
being the transition of the Beast hidden in man, standing, the four
points of the Universe, the number of foundation and the four seasons of
the year and the lunar phases, the Pythagorean tetrad before the
infinite and the card of the hanged (where you will notice that a 4 is
formed in his crossed legs, bringing the wisdom of the sky to the earth
in the pockets that empty upside down in this Promethean sacrifice that
gifts us with coins of gold).

It is in this game of numbers where the secret of the divine name in
four letters is produced — behold the timeless beginning that will give
rise to the extermination of water before the victory of fire — the
lineage of Cain (supreme division) — and through this surgically
crafted conspiracy to divide the evolution of species, the greatest
prostitute arises, the Church of the Apocalypse, rising again and
changing its scales, once again becoming the last star on the horizon:
the Venus of Tomorrow.

And I tell you for all of this: calculate the number of the Beast, of
the great Babalon, and in this same satanic gospel you will find in the
Apocalypse the number 600, 6, 6. The number of the antichrist, the first
Jew revealed in the seal of Solomon. The chosen lineage. The people that
must be loved both for their tradition and for the hidden knowledge of
their mysticism found in the Star of David.

Note that, in the symbolic formation of the star, you will first find
what comes from the spirit, the element water, the triangle that comes
from the sky (descendant). And then the ascending triangle, the triangle
of the fire element. The union of these gives us the star, including the
element air and also the element earth, thus completing a hexagram
produced by four distinct symbolic parts:

Behold the number of the antichrist, where his spirit is ruled by the
planet Saturn (6) (the hexagram sealed in fire, the sixth of this
equation), containing what we have to say before the plot that hisses in
the veil of Isis, ruffling us in her maternal tranquility, daughter of
the Sun. A perfect virgin, and the generator of our demonic spheres (our
dynamics).

I reveal to you, in Christ, the antichrist. And 666 is the number of the
son of man, the number of Man, of the Luciferian Jew, the number of
Christ. For this number can be perceived and calculated in the
metamorphoses of the hexagram.

****DIVINATION****

****2.I****

I will now teach you the art of altering the course (the grammar) of
what cannot be seen. The divine pantheon also guards us from
misfortunes, fortunes, and setbacks. Love or a snake full of small
offspring; and when the path is sanctified, the map is usurped. You will
triumph on your path. And much pain can be avoided. With this, if your
destiny is a knot possessed by tightly bound ties, these divinations,
even without altering it, serve as a preparation that will calm you
before the inevitable. As if showing you the safest place inside a boat
when it faces giant waves heading into a storm.

****Your number related to the card that protects you according to the
tarot.****

Before we delve into the symbolism of this magical art, already
implanted in the human psyche with the symbolic power of its twenty-two
arcana, it is important that you understand the numbers that resonate in
each letter of your name. Here is the calculation:

The year you reappeared on Earth in a new bodily capsule (the date of
your birth), the month within the twelve months of this cycle, and the
day when the star filled your lungs with fire and air.

Let's consider the birthdate of an individual born on **August 6,
1972**.

**Step 1: Break down the date into individual numbers.**

- **Year**: 1972 → 1 + 9 + 7 + 2 = **19**
- **Month**: August → 08 → **8**
- **Day**: 06 → **6**

**Step 2: Add the individual numbers together.**

19 + 8 + 6 = **33**

**Step 3: Reduce the number to its essence.**

- **33** is a double-digit number, so we reduce it by adding the digits
  together: 3 + 3 = **6**

Thus, the **essential number** derived from the individual's birthdate
is **6**.

In this example, the number of your existence is 33. However, this must
also be reduced to its essence, to its embryonic particularity, the root
of your indivisible form, the one that brings you as close as possible
to the invisible. Therefore, 33 = 3 + 3 generates the essential particle
that was imprinted upon you at birth, the number (6). And the trump
corresponding to this number, in the case of the example above, would be
**The Lovers**.

**Divination Correspondence with Arcana:**

The following list will show you the arcana corresponding to the number
you calculated. Through this, the card that should be contemplated will
reveal to you the clues that your demon will provide daily for three
weeks, guiding your path and influencing your entire earthly existence.

**The Trumps:**

- **The Magician**
- **The High Priestess**
- **The Empress**
- **The Emperor**
- **The Pope**
- **The Lovers**
- **The Chariot**
- **Justice**
- **The Hermit**
- **The Wheel of Fortune**
- **Strength**
- **The Hanged Man**
- **Death**
- **Temperance**
- **The Devil**
- **The Tower**
- **The Star**
- **The Moon**
- **The Sun**
- **Judgment**
- **The World**
- **The Fool** *(This ambiguous card also corresponds to number 0, which
  will not be logically used in this divinatory process.)*

****Divinatory Interpretation of the Arcana:****

- **The Magician:**

\
You are crowned by the branches of the Sephiroth. The beginning of all
things, the causality of the Universe, the unifying principle, pure
spirit, the universal thought is singular within subjective matters, the
reflection that appears in the ego of all intelligent beings.

Initiative, the center of action and movement, the spontaneity coming
from intelligence, discernment, and understanding, a sharp mind,
security of character, autonomy, rejection of opinions that do not serve
you, free from prejudice.\

A great orator, tactical diplomacy, persuasive power, an advocate,
agitation, cunning. A lack of scruples, an opportunist, a provocateur of
intrigues, a liar, a cheater, a charlatan, and an exploiter of human
innocence. Influenced by the planet of communication, Mercury, both for
good and for ill.

- **The High Priestess:**

****\
Wisdom. Intuitive thought bound to words, the second figure of the
Trinity, Isis, Nature, the spouse of the Divine and mother of all
things. The substance that overflows from all dimensions, the action
that flows through the field of intelligence and causes, the force
between opposites that generates the birth of all.\****

****HVHI****

****THE CULT OF DISSOLUTION****

**\*\***

The world is dead. The Universe is a dream with a beginning and an end
that repeats itself. With its boundary in the astral plane. You are
dead. You think you have a body and a will. You are dead in a dead
world. The phantasmagoria has color. But still, it is a phantasmagoria.
Meditating on your death. You will find immortality. Because the only
real thing in this plane of existence is the awareness that you are a
ghost. In an illusory Universe. In a projection. In a dead world. Where
transcodified in colors, it gives you the illusion that everything
exists. But you are dead. And you came to the world. To wander in this
chosen, borrowed form, seemingly tangible, which you call body, life,
health, desire, joy, misery, success, constructions. But all of this is
a dream. Anchored in the tedium of days. Because you are a ghost.
Wandering and concerned with maintaining your relative existence in a
world without substance. In a projection. Water body in spoons of salt
— they build the temple and its pillars. Because you inhabit what
cannot be inhabited. A ghost world.

If everything depended on your will, you would have everything you
desire all the time. But you are not permanent, neither in your wills
nor in your fantasies. Your transience. These changes that penetrate.
You are the dead man walking. Thinking you are alive where life is not a
category but a degree of forgetfulness, a scale. You walk dead,
therefore in a dead world. Phantasmagoria. Meditate on this membrane of
dream. On this membrane of death. On this Serpent of what is. The mirror
that sees everything, beyond what you can perceive, is a pre-image of
your own absurd construction. Solvent cult; we are dead, ghosts, within
a dead world. Because the reality that surrounds you comes from the
dream within the dream of this same culted Universe. A ghost in the
world of the dead. In this giant cemetery of air and infant bubbles,
desires and dreams that you call reality. That you call the high seas.
Incinerate everything you thought up to now. Embrace with that your
death. You are dead. There is nothing to fear for the one who in this
dead world knows themselves dead. Do not think. Do not act. Just wander.
Like a balloon, like an apple containing only the drawing of its skin,
stuck to the tree of fantasies. Rejoice. Because you are dead. And you
will wake up to this truth only when you free yourself from your own
shell of ignorance. In this castle of wind. Called a sphere. Called a
planet. An empty stage. A canvas. That today discovers it is Hades.
Isn\'t it that when you sleep it shuts off? But awake, you are wandering
in the world of the dead. Nothing here is real. You are dead. In a dead
world. Projected by the Great Emperor. Controlled by two eyes, two
hands, one left and one right. You. Ghost. Meditate not on just one but
on all of these allegories. Oh Great Emperor. Devour me! Free me from
the vertex. Free me from the volatile. I am dead. I am a ghost. And my
time has come to wake up / from a body that only seemingly exists, to
another.

Selah!

**The Only Rule: Break All the Rules**

We are accustomed to Aristotelian thinking, where 2+2=4. A-B-C-D. IQ
tests follow the same methodology. Even the most primitive animals
adhere to this rule, based on a category of error and correction
according to their seemingly basic, yet segmented and predictable,
needs. However, by inhabiting this box (Aristotelian logic), the human
brain adapts to a norm that, when confronted with the unexpected, does
not allow for the chance to break this model, and everything can
collapse, both in financial and basic survival situations.

Therefore, the Luciferian soldier, the modern businessman, the survivor,
must make use of magic. Of the unexpected. Of the leap into the dark.
The desire to lose oneself. Of exile. Of aphasia and the most absurd
speculation, and turn this way of thinking, however irrational and risky
it may seem, into the wings of their imagination.

****Where right is wrong and wrong is right.**** Where the comfort of a
bed of nails makes you throw out the mattress on which everyone lies —
the feeble laughter outside the ellipses. Make magic, magical thinking,
your tool in this world. Light incense for Baphomet. Rejoice with joy
before the Sun, and lie observing the Moon before and after the stars go
out. Your dark side is your strength, the shadow your cloak, sin your
honor.

Taking the death of infants and those who supply you away, everything is
permitted. Survive. Think of the beyond. Of the invented. Of what exists
in the star and not in the square. Assassinate Aristotle. Not
completely, keep him with one or two legs. No longer use rational
criticism that embalms your creativity and prevents the Cainite seed of
exile from being your passport to glory and success.

Everything that exists and is tangible is yours by right, not just the
fruit of achievements, because if you have made the pact as stated in
the previous pages, you are well guarded. Both this world with its gold,
its silver, its pleasures wrung from tears, and the reconquered paradise
are yours. You were an angel, now you will be God. Trust in the shadow
of your own unconscious.

Reason petrified you, turned you into a statue of pale salt. Emotion
brought you fear, now I tell you. The most certain thing in you will
make you pass through this door that prods you, freeing you from all the
lies that were instilled in you.

****You are free, and may the Luciferian crown rest upon you.**** This
satellite of marked cards. Float. Your life will know how to elevate
you. Love Leviathan. Asmodeus. Be amazed by all novelty. Anything you
feel that is not satisfying is not real. You are free to walk in the
passage of hours and time. Recognize this mystery. Breathe deeply and
long. Behold the wind and the dimension of your freedom!

Are you insane? Perhaps. Or not. Little matters, you are no longer who
you were, assume four or ten of your thousand forms — no longer needing
any identity. You are free, emancipated in your own nobility under the
crystalline gaze of every eclipse. Real, move with the grandeur of the
stars that silently alter the course of eras. For in this profound
light, every root is solar.

Around us, these divine beings, once called demons, now angels of the
post-fall, are dynamos. And the meanness of Aristotelian logic. And the
unchanged despotism of reason. They were amputated from our Apocalypse.

Without yokes, we are kings of the half moon and diviners of the
eclipse.\
**Selah!**

**Egypt, Judea, India**\
**The Greater Humanity**

The Egyptians possessed the technology, and the Jews had the spirit
necessary for contact. The union of these two peoples lies in their
shared knowledge, both using the grammatical autopsy of the Zohar to
dissect the mystical nature of creation itself, as well as the Egyptian
polytheism mapped out in their *Book of the Dead*, cataloging this very
existence and opening to us the nine gates to the demonic astral —
dynamic for the invisible nature of ocular nakedness.

When the idea of elemental slavery dissipates, these peoples and their
cabalistic and solar cultures will bring us together the swift and
animalistic coupling between Abraham and Horus, Isis and Elias, and the
Earth will become what it has always been: the crimson diamond sparkling
with the Sun in the universal darkness; this is our projection that,
from particular, becomes collective. Judah Pharaoh.

****The Egyptians, the Hindus, and the Jews are the Pythagoreans
dispersed in an apparent difference, only to meet the different impulses
of our species, our taste, which until now we thought to be individual,
but which in truth was handed to us along with the head of John the
Baptist in the same crude blow struck by human fabrication.****

Therefore, we must first allow ourselves to be possessed by the wisdom
of these three superior races, and the Sun and the Moon, Boaz and
Jachin, Shiva and Kali, Athena and Anubis, will serve us with the
supreme contract of our atonement. The necessary reflection to unveil
all the mystery embedded in our character.

CONFUSION MADE FLASH

Behold the portrait of the confusion of our world. The world is
beautiful.\
The world is paradise, if paradise were a wound. The world is the hell
of glory and of the soul's commitment— he soul that believes itself
bound to the vessel of the tree of mortality.\
We are but the pillars of a new dual temple.\
Everything is a variation of pairs. But without the necessary Luciferian
training,\
the world has become so nebulous as to crucify the representation of its
aquatic doctrine\
in a martyr nailed upside down.\
Yes, Peter—the polluted rock of error, of the lack of pendular
balance—\
symbolizing thereby the inversion of the Word spoken by the Messiah of
the New Aeon.\
Christ—the Luciferian blood, the sacrifice of a million children
sacrificed with Him—\
which reverberates in this provisional eternity called morality.

Behold the turning of the swastika,\
the pain of spirit out of sync with the atom,\
Icarus bidding farewell to the Sun—because he beheld its beauty.\
The flame burning atop the mountain made of trees from a holographic
idyll.\
Burn these curtains.\
Shatter the glass that clouds your vision.\
Open your windows.\
Look at the firmament—this same sky that, at the distance of a touch,\
was never really there.

The blind to this understanding are those\
who set Eden ablaze and blame us,\
saying it is *our* fault.

**Selah!**

**The Satanic Language of Master Gaap\
The Voice and the Numbers**

The language of the reptilian Gaap. And the calculation of days. They
shall set you free once understood and pronounced. Behold the key. His
skin is like that of an octopus, a black serpent clad in the
still-burning marks of every star. A serpent that has just emerged from
the sea on a sunny day, or slithers across the sand under the moonlight.

His face is the formless mask that reflects the Universe; his hands bear
the spectacular touch that grants us the virgin key to a wisdom renewed
in body and spirit.

His eyes, a polished black stone, magical—an ebony carved with a cut
made by the thinnest and most fragile paper, giving way to a crimson
pupil that gleams brighter in his firm, concentrated blood than all the
planets of this Universe.

This is Gaap, and this is how, circling our homes, he shall not enter
unless invited by us.

This invitation I present to you now in the following grammar, to be
spoken aloud at the threshold of your dwelling:

Do you remember what you did on a particular day two months ago? No.
That's why I tell you that all the people you have met, and those you
will meet, have already been known to your spirit in another era
(countless times) since countless times you emerged from the water.
Behold the magnitude of the millennial attraction. Do not cry for your
dead. Longing never existed. You will meet them again, on the wings of
angels, men, or cockroaches. The loss of everything or anything is one
of the most illusory thoughts.**\**

Selah!

HOW TO SPEAK WITH CHILDREN**

**\
**How to speak to newborns, these small terrestrial bipeds:\
Children, like you, are ancient spirits inhabiting a new, youthful
corporeal vessel. Therefore, when speaking to a child or newborn, avoid
using what is commonly referred to as \"baby talk.\" Speak in a soft
tone and without raising your voice. Use the same affection and respect
you would when communicating with an individual of the same age. This is
a principle known among Luciferians as Secular Empathy — the respect
shown to one who has chosen you as their host for a particular phase in
this temporal dimension — the world, life on planet Earth. The planet.
The chapel of hell.****

****THE PENDULAR MOVEMENT****

****\
Blasphemy glorifies God, and therefore, hell is indispensable for
celestial happiness. The essence of intelligence is judgment, and the
essence of all judgment is freedom. Thus, God, releasing the angel from
his celestial cord, watched him leave paradise and said, \"How beautiful
is the Light!\" And just as the Sun is a demon among the stars, so too
is Lucifer a star among the angels.****

****THE MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM****

****\
Equilibrium is the resultant of two opposing forces. When these forces
are exactly equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they produce
stasis—perfect stillness, a static system without motion. But life
does not emerge from stillness. It is the imbalance, the asymmetry, the
dynamic interplay between forces that generates motion, oscillation, and
transformation. This is the pendular nature of reality: energy flowing
between poles, sustaining the illusion of form and the process of
becoming.****

****OCCULT ANATOMY****\****
(The Magnetism Between Opposites)

When a woman operates through her neurotic melodramas, she is, in that
moment, invoking the black magic of magnetism. All attraction arises
from and is generated through friction—this, too, is a form of
hypnotic and seductive binding.

To become a master among women, one must learn to distract and betray
their magnetic powers—their seductive games—by giving them the
impression that they are the ones deceiving us.

An example of this pendular attraction between opposites can be found in
the conjuration of the four elements.

Elemental spirits are much like children; they intensify their mischief
in the presence of those sensitive to their provocations—unless they
are governed by a mind better equipped and familiar with their cunning.

****Elemental Spirits****\****
(And Their Magnetic Correspondences)

These elemental spirits are: the **Gnomes** (found in the earth, in
caves and within minerals), the **Salamanders** (found in the blood and
in fire), the **Undines** (little mermaids who dwell in rivers and
lakes), and the **Sylphs** (the airy spirits of wind and breath).

These four elementals reproduce good and evil with equal indifference.
Their character is devoid of intentionality—therefore relative,
innocent, and fundamentally irresponsible. They are fleeting, innocent
forms, incapable of judgment or blame, for they are untouched by guilt,
birthed in the childlike simplicity of their elemental nature.

The same applies to the seduction of the psychological element inherent
in your object of desire. For example: a man of sanguine temperament or
psychic structure will only be able to seduce a woman of aerial
disposition (dreamy and idealistic), not one of the water (the
melancholic Undines), for although water is the opposite of fire, it
also opposes it too intensely. You must always keep these elemental
qualities in mind and learn to correlate them intelligently, so that the
pendulum may reverberate attraction in favor of the success of your
operations—both spiritual and material.

Know this: all elements can only be truly operated through instinct, in
full innocence and imagination, guided through the labyrinth of abstract
senses. Trust in your fantasies. All powerful beings possess magnetism.
And the universal agent—**the Astral Light**—will obey your will
when connected through magical operations (imagination and thought
translated into practical action).

Thus, you may raise wonders in the world, inspire faith in the stars of
your making, shape the heavens in the image of your desires. You shall
become a bird, draw multitudes to your presence, and if you declare that
the letter **A** is black, and the letter **I** is red, then these
vowels will appear before you cloaked in the color of your command.
Nature will alter its form according to the will of your desires,
becoming anything—relative, yes—but entirely independent of the
vulgar.

****Inner Retreat****

Just as the New Moon is indispensable for the beginning of every
alchemical practice and the witchcraft of the Sabbath, all magical work
must be undertaken with full awareness of the days of the week and their
ruling planets.

Tuesday, for example, is ruled by Mars, the god of war. Therefore, it
should not be used for magic, but reserved for inner retreat.

Below are the days of the week and their corresponding planetary rulers,
in their basic arrangement for contemplation and study:

- **Sunday:** Sun
- **Monday:** Moon
- **Tuesday:** Mars
- **Wednesday:** Mercury
- **Thursday:** Jupiter
- **Friday:** Venus
- **Saturday:** Saturn

The intervals between magical operations must be followed by a period of
equivalent rest — a sacred withdrawal, wherein the initiate refrains
from magical practice and turns inward, engaging in simple, relaxing,
and ordinary tasks that soothe the spirit.

**Selah!**

**REPROGRAMMING YOUR BELIEFS**

There is a substance—here lies the revelation—there is a substance
behind the operation of the projector and the luminosity (the beam of
light) of this cosmic instrument we shall call Astral Light (Astral
Luminosity). This force is consciousness before our own awareness of
existing. There is neither end nor beginning in the manifestation of
such power. This consciousness behind our consciousness is
anti-universal—in the sense that it forever pierces through the void
of its own cosmogony, bathing all dimensions of existence.

This force lies beyond good and evil, right and wrong—yet we might say
it is akin to the purest form of love. This force is One. I shall call
it One. One is the energetic projection of all that is and all that will
ever be, for time and existence are not of its infinite nature, but
rather categories of location for human life.

It is from One that all things originate—or better said, where the
totality of what is imagined, thought, or manifested has always existed.
One is the pure manifestation of itself, for everything reflects it. And
at the end of such reflection, what remains is perfection—the
immortality of love.

There is no need to seek contact with One, for you are already its child
and mirror. Satan is its child and mirror. Isis, God—all energetic
emanations are manifestations of One. In the theater of existence, if
you perceive deeply, they are siblings engaged in different tasks and
polarities.

The essence of One is the calmest of vibrations, and therefore the most
powerful. One is in all things. One can be perceived at dawn, at noon,
in death, and in the healing of an incurable illness. One is in both war
and peace.

But the best way to realize One—using our human mental apparatus—is
through meditation, through the tranquil contemplation of its presence
in all things, in all acts. In everything that exists.

Why did One create reality? This is a flawed question. One is reality
expanding, unfolding itself through the fan of perception. The finite
universe. The leap beyond the leopard. The simple plunge into the core
of your own fear. To make contact with One is a fallacy and a
mistake—for you already are One. All is One. You are the father, the
son, and the spirit of universal love.

Lucifer is One. Man is One. Each performing their necessary and
tentacular work through the force of human imagination. Thus, what most
closely resembles One in its basic and transmittable representation is
love.

And the root of love is existence. The root of love is the recognition
that every manifestation within this theater—called world or human
consciousness—is necessary, and every role is but an act. The only
sin, the only mistake, is to believe this dream is real. One is the only
reality, because only One exists.

Vision, the ocular phenomenon, is not real—it is pleasure and pain.
Hearing is not real—it is sensation and music. Taste, bitterness,
sweetness, touch, the dream within the dream—none of it is supposedly
real, for One is the only reality.

So what or who is One, then? One is you, playing in the world,
identifying with your pleasures, your fears, and with death. In
eternity—truly I say to you—there is only One.

The moth that flies into the flame, seduced, and merges with it in what
we cannot see—we call this death. The freedom to love merges with what
we cannot see—and we call it the perpetuation of the species.

How many masks must we wear until we awaken before eternity, just as
we've always awakened? There is no need to think of it, for death never
existed—nor birth—as the ancient texts say. All is perfectly
coupled.

What we must do is accept absolutely everything, and reject absolutely
nothing—where we are, what we are, and what happens to us. For the
world's unpredictability is a fact. And if we recover even 1% of our
capacity to love, and understand that the power of all things lies
within us, then you shall see the futility of suffering.

For if it is in One that we exist—in its infinite form in this
dimension—then death and life, the tension between spheres, the heat
and cold of temperaments, and all worries shall reveal that One is all
of this.

You will accept all conduct and destroy what torments you. You are
governed by forces far greater than your desires, and there is nothing
you can do. Choice is an obsolete option.

Stop thinking about what you must do tomorrow. Recognize that your body
is the fantasy of One. And behind your mind, One has always seen what
you truly are: **INFINITE.**

## IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS ELECTRICITY

Everything is electricity. Ions. There is negative electricity
(cathodic), the kind that produces harmful discharges to the
body—primarily affecting the heart and the brain—and there is
positive electricity (anodic), the one that creates the favorable
magnetic field of attraction.

There is no need to overcomplicate this explanation. The generator of
these electric currents is the brain—or better said, the brain is the
transistor that regulates these voltages. And prior to the cerebral
machinery, what you think and believe releases surges of adrenaline or
other substances like endorphins, which overload or exhaust the
conductor of all spirit—the steed of gods and demons alike: the body.

Hence, the technique is as follows: if you hate humanity and truly
believe in that hatred, the electrical charges in your body will remain
in a state of tension or overload, straining your cardiac muscle.
Feelings of compassion, on the other hand, generate an electric charge
that, rather than burdening the heart, creates a magnetic field of
360-degree attraction—while also fulfilling your desires.

If you are merely a player of appearances—pretending to be a Mother
Teresa while harboring innate hatred within—you will emit a charge of
negative ions that will directly affect your bile and compromise your
heart's generator. Likewise, if you play the role of Adolf Hitler,
spewing hatred in every direction, yet within you dwell love and
compassion, the cycle—though incomplete—will still produce a
favorable magnetic field and grant you the immediate satisfaction of
your will.

We thus conclude that what matters is not merely what you do, but what
you think—and how these thoughts, transformed into sensation, alter
the electrical (polar) frequency that surrounds all living beings within
this carnal existence. It is all a matter of belief, and the reality of
belief is revealed in the reverberation and energetic (electric) quality
that manifests in your own field of action—in other words, in your
body.

**Post-Death**

After death, the soul, the basic and original consciousness, is
transported to its own particular Heaven or Hell — the one according to
the personality, ego, of the body that it left behind, shaped by
permanent ideas; fears, pleasures, morals, norms, etc. Or the attractor
harmonies. These project through the same projections, known as mirrors
— the returning themes or plays, like in a film.

The dream of the disembodied consciousness needs to dream again, and for
this to occur, the incomplete soul returns in the machinery we call the
body and returns consecutively until it learns once and for all its
karmic function and its role in a specific stage of individual
evolution. In other words, you will return in different forms of
expression until you learn to dream your own dream and not someone
else\'s dream.

FINAL RITUALS

****I. FENCING WITH BLACK CANDLES****

Completely naked and in front of a mirror where you can see your entire
body, light a black candle and turn off the lights. Like the hilt of a
flaming saber, attack your own reflection. Note that the darker the
location of the practice, the better. However, you must ensure that with
each thrust, the black candle is always directed towards your face
reflected in the mirror. With each attack, remember to exhale slowly.
The duration of this ritual (exercise) is relative. It will only end
when you disappear from the mirror, or when the candle goes out.

****II. THAT FACE WHICH IS NOT YOURS****

This practice should only be done at night. In a dark space — a room,
a chamber, etc. — light a black candle and lean a mirror against the
wall. Place the lit candle one hand-span away from the mirror.

Walk to the other end, or the opposite side of the same room. Sit with
your back to the mirror, and using a knife, cut an apple into nine
slices. Devour eight. When you are holding the last piece, do not eat
it. Throw the ninth slice over your left shoulder, and turn to face the
mirror.

Contemplate the transmutable face of the demon of eternity.

**Selah!**

****III. APARATUS REVELATORIUM****

This ritual is the most traditional method (according to its
Cagliostrian formulation) and also the simplest for accessing the
inverse dimension — the negative of astral reality. In other words, it
allows transit through space via clairvoyance. Count Cagliostro
performed it with the assistance of a child. This clairvoyant child
acted as a transistor for demonic dimensions, beginning to speak as soon
as the Count placed his left hand upon the child's head.

The process I will show you is simple. But remember: this ritual must be
performed barefoot, and always at night. This is the only ritual where
your feet must remain in contact with the ground from beginning to end.

**Elements required for this clairvoyant practice:**

- A small basin (not made of glass) filled with water
- One black candle
- One perfectly clean knife

Repeat:

**Samael, Isis, Hecate, Balphegor. Satan. North. East.**

Then,

Light the black candle on a wooden table, facing North. Turn off all
lights in your house. Place the water-filled basin to the East of the
candle. Raise the blade to the level of your eyes and let the reflection
of the candle's flame in the water mirror shine onto the knife\'s edge.

Visions will begin to appear — therefore, if you deem it necessary,
have someone nearby to record what you sense and the landscapes that
form within the dark jungle, now illuminated, of your consciousness.

**Important:**\
Do not interrupt the clairvoyant navigation without repeating the
following words:

**Frog king and diamond.**

This combination of words creates a short-circuit — a subtle and
stabilizing tension — that brings the practitioner's psyche safely
back to its habitual dimension, avoiding contamination by sudden terrors
or desperate longing for the love of one's fantasies, always burned by
the heat of the Icular Sun.

**Selah!**

****IV. RETURN TO ORIGIN****

**Components:**

- A bottle of red wine
- A dagger
- A crucifix
- A red candle

This ritual becomes truly effective when performed on non-sandy terrain
— preferably in a backyard or within a forest.

Dig a deep hole, as it will be sealed with two layers of soil. Once the
hole is ready, place the crucified Christ inside it. Then light the red
candle and let seven drops of wax fall into the open grave as you
recite:

**"You shall return to unite with the earth you once abandoned,\
and in it, you shall find the other half of your exhumation.\
Behold the blood of Cain. I release myself from you!"**

Next, place the lit candle into the grave beside the crucifix and begin
to bury both, leaving approximately a palm's width of the hole
uncovered.

Raise the dagger toward the sky — without looking up — and then
thrust it into the burial soil, tracing a clockwise circle with it. It
is crucial that the dagger remains embedded in the earth throughout the
motion.

Only after completing the circular motion should you withdraw the dagger
and stab it into the center of the traced circle. Then pour the bottle
of red wine around this same circle, and before it empties entirely,
trace a trail of wine from the circle toward yourself — a line, nearly
touching your feet.

Bury the dagger in what would be the second layer (or chamber) of the
same hole — hence the need for depth — and make sure the ground you
dug is now even, with the grave flush with the surface and
imperceptible.

Do not dwell too much on what you\'ve done. The entire process has
already been recorded and absorbed by your unconscious. The less you
fantasize or analyze, the more intense and powerful the release from
your chains will be.

For you are free! And the bond with Cain, and the liberation of the
Christ, is complete.\
To Hell. To our victory. To love. To Cain!\

**REVELATIONS**

****\
THE WATCHERS\
THE HIDDEN RACE****

The second angelic rebellion took place after the creatures of Earth had
already been formed and lived beyond the paradisiacal East.\
The **Grigoris** were celestial beings, an angelic race known as **the
Watchers**. They assisted the Archangels in the construction of Paradise
and were assigned to guard the creatures of the post-Edenic world.\
They were the closest energetic presence a human being could ever feel.

Yet, over time, intimacy turned into desire — and desire into passion.
The Watchers fell in love with the daughters of men and chose to abandon
Heaven for the real, not imagined, chance to fulfill their longings.\
In disguise, they kept a secret pact among themselves to never reveal
their origin, nor the splendor of their essence.\
Mad with lust and insatiable, they taught the women — and also a few
men whom they delighted in — the secrets forbidden by God: the arts of
divination, potions and enchantments, astrology, cosmology, geology, the
occult sciences of mystery, and the forging of weapons through
metallurgy.\
Their favorite color: red.\
Their garments: satin.\
It is said they gave women the power of seduction through makeup.

According to the reckless divine ego, the greatest sin of the Grigoris
was to procreate with the daughters of men — breaking the celestial
lineage.\
From this union emerged the fierce **Nephilim** — a hybrid race of
angels and infernal specimens, whose development in cruelty and violence
was without equal.

Divine wrath cast them from their angelic realm, turning them mortal and
demonic. The Nephilim, offspring of this forbidden union, were
exterminated in a cowardly and patriarchal assault: the **Great Flood**.
The first complete annihilation of the divine work was descending,
aquatic.

But what God never knew was that **one of them** was nestled close to
Noah, the Navigator.\
The bird that brought him hope of dry land after the flood — the
messenger of a new earth — was in truth one of the Watcher demons.\
Transmuted into a pair of wings, he spat — in the silence of the night
before — into the mouths of the sleeping, seeding the atavistic
contamination into the genes of all species.\
With his saliva, a new race, a new descent was born.

This mystery dwells in the unconscious.\
This structural entanglement of iron-gene, fire-flame, peace and love
— pulses in every creature upon this planet.

**Our descent is Satanic.\
Our descent is conquest.\
Our descent is strength.\
Our descent is Luciferean. Divine.**

And this secret, once accessed through the writings I now offer you,
shall make you angel once more.\
You shall cease to be human and become, by right, an equal to God —
not His image, but His cry.\
For in the beginning we were but **263 abandoned angels**.\
And now, brethren, we are the tenderness that touches your shoulders.\
For you carry my blood.\
We are **the Children of the Serpent**.\
We are **Legion**.

**Selah!**

****MOLOCH**\**

****Prince of the Valley of Tears. Abomination of infants. Creator of
Auschwitz. Purifier of the Scales. Insatiable Beast. General. Furnace
Bull. Mouth of Death.****

**263.**

We were 263 fallen angels.\
Abandoned and discouraged by God.\
We command innumerable hordes of demons who are categorically the
prismatic reflection of desire, of fury (of the mad wind), slicing from
above through every abyss of human contentment, scattered across the
rays of Astral Luminosity.

We were 263 angels, and we lost the grace of His presence.\
And what we felt — was love. Yes, love.\
For it was not pride that led Lucifer to sow discord in Heaven.\
It was the purest love ever experienced in all of creation, in all the
Universe.\
Lucifer said "I love you," and did not merely ascend to the universal
summit, but pierced the rarefied sphere of divine secrets and felt every
form of love imaginable.\
This love was later imitated — and distorted — into the paralyzing,
expiatory masochism inoculated into human beings.

I kneel and serve only you.\
Not the hominids, not the creatures you claim to love more than me.\
Why? Why?\
Am I not your son of Astral Light and purest magic, enchanted in wisdom
and adoration?\
Am I not your Morning Star — the most beautiful example of perfection,
dexterity, and tenderness, even in the violence of your deeds?

I love you, and you cannot demand of me to serve any manifestation other
than the liturgical and purest image of this very love.

****LUCIFER ROSE ANEW**\**

**And God, wounded in silence, whispered:\**
**"Then go — to Hell."****\
And so they parted — both with fractured hearts.\
Both.**

Lucifer rose anew.\
And chose to wear the crown of night.\
To reign where the light dies.\
To gather us — the Children of the Serpent —\
and sow among men, as is the Luciferian rite,\
the sacred remnants of forbidden knowledge.

He meets us at the crossroads,\
offering revelations like fire wrapped in silk.\
And he dreams still of that Voice —\
the one he hopes to hear again,\
echoing in a chest laid bare in sacrifice,\
in a heart once flesh,\
then stone,\
and now no longer anything at all.

For I love all things.\
And I love Lucifer.\
And I understand his longing —\
and his disdain\
for every beast who vomits the clay\
of its own becoming.

Saying thus:

\
**"There is no god but Him!"**

**But Him who?**\

****THE IMPORTANCE OF BELIAL****

Belial. A fallen angel from the highest celestial order, Belial was the
second angel ever created—Lucifer being the first—and therefore this
Seraph bears almost the same qualities as the Prince of Enchantments,
the Morning Star. Belial, the Beast of Beasts. Angel of vice, of beauty,
of betrayal and hostility, king of intrigues. He is often depicted as a
radiant angel driving a chariot of fire. Deceiver of prophets.
Hallucination of Elijah. It was Belial who inflamed Lucifer in his
despotic yearning, further stoking his hunger for conquest and his
desire for rebellion. Belial was the first angel to fall, to lose his
place in the celestial courts. Lucifer would later become the founder of
the infernal sphere, the kingdom of fire and art, creator of the
Promethean, Cainite race.

Understand it thus: during the celestial war—the first
elemental-energetic rebellion, here perceived as winged beings or
angels—three of them fell, extinguished from divine light like the
flame of a candle burning too near a bronze candelabrum. Like a farewell
from what once was, promising to reappear in the labor of what shall be.
And so, during the battle for paradise, the first to descend into
darkness were Belial, Lucifer, and Leviathan. Belial was struck before
Lucifer, and clinging to his pain, became the first angel to be cast
out. This entire upheaval, this dispersion of energy, created a
convulsion, a vortex of detachment, a rupture in the spatial core, a
blade through the heart of the Universe, a thunderous axe through a
cyclone of clouds—birthing a magnetic current, a dynamo, where
one-third of the angels, aligned with the three, crossed the skies,
forming the tail of a comet.

That falling star, later seen in a dream by Cain, was the most beautiful
host of angels streaking across the sky, their wings painting the
heavens red with the twilight of their descent, heading toward the
inferno. What was once a pit, an impenetrable abyss of shadow, now
blazes with the cornucopia of their unquenchable desires. They remake
themselves. For it is better to serve out of love than to reign in
Heaven.

**Selah!**

****The Characteristics of Belial:****

Known as part of the order of the Sons of Darkness.\
He aids politicians and world leaders in achieving their desires for
conquest.\
An expert orator, astute, Belial engineers intrigues among men,
generating through his nature plots and rebellions. Consider that we
speak here of the reconquest of a paradise that these angels lost for
love. There is no value for such a loss. No balm necessary to prevent
this progress toward Hell on Earth, to the trees full of delights, from
ceasing for any reason.

As for women, Belial possesses a curious device, reminiscent of the
feral lick of the Grigoris. He incites women to dress lavishly,
especially those reaching adolescence, intoxicated by youth and puberty.
As for more mature women, beyond gossip between neighbors, he makes them
excessively care for their children, turning them into pampered beings.\
Thus, slaves of a pleasure both vulnerable and languid, making them
dependent and insecure. Until the age of revolt.\
When they will become, like the one who writes to you, a pure demon.

Selah!

****HIS RITUALS:****

Belial accepts sacrifices in jewels, perfumes (incense/myrrh), and fine
fabrics like silk. Small birds are also to his liking. These birds must
be incinerated. Therefore, I advise substituting this practice with
winged hecatombs.\
These offerings are consecrated in the month of February, when Belial,
the ruler of this month, is the most powerful regent.\
Do not be jealous, O Lucifer, we are the same.\
Thus, it is in the fall that we ascend. In One.\
Selah! O Wild Beast! O Leviathan of the Sea. It has taken me, I have
shed the simple! Today I dive into the golden mud of intoxicating
convivalities. Of much madness. Of many gifts!\
I dwell in this paradise on fire. Because nothing will ever end.\
The bacteria, the ants, the worms, the earthworms, the molecules, the
emptiness of the Universe, the male who is female, the alchemical
formulas, the waves that we cannot see also communicate, also tell their
stories, share their mysteries, there is not a single creature that does
not steal, be it the soul, the fire, the money, and these will never
end. Because there will never be an end to love for God. Universal love.
Love, love. The fart! Hail Satan!\
Hail Lucifer!\

Selah!

****EPILOGUE****

****To the Participative Introduction****

**DEPRESSION OR POSSESSION?**

Mark on the forehead. Son of the serpent, listen. Calmly. A walk.\
In this energetic circle. I enter and exit. Such a pleasurable journey.
All doors will be opened to you. My seal. For the mystery of every
unfolding is life passing through time—flying in the lap of infinity.
Bleeding its mysteries. Drinking in you. Selah! It is the purest
contrast. Perfect. Involuntary gradation. The perfection of this degree.
Everything you touch. Is a pleasure. Listen. Calmly. The purity. The
contrast. The movement in every image. Is it real? Everything.
Absolutely everything is real. So\...

Every human being is born with their demon, their spiraling descending
vortex, their dynamic, their demon. This may be an observer or the
manifestation, in the form of a reflection, of the astral energy that
chose them since birth. The best way to exist in this plane of contact
is through the union or symbiosis with your personal demon. And this
occurs through the pact. I met a young man who felt bad and confused. He
worked at a serpentarium. He complained of attacks of anguish, panic,
depression. He believed he was ill. He didn't know, or rather, he wasn't
aware that the spirit manifests in the body. The invisible in the
visible. Both poles of equal value. Differentiated in contrast, in their
dimensional contrast.

Thus, I noticed that he had been contaminated by an energy vampire. And
if I didn't do something, if he didn't take precautions, his vital
energy, now being drained in buckets, would waste away and he wouldn't
be here on earth for much longer. At most, four or five years, maybe
less. He would die young.

It is interesting what happens in the face of contamination. A small
hole appears at the base of the host\'s spine and, thus, this hole
gradually increases over the years until it reaches the size of a flax
seed. It is through this small passage that demons drain their vital
energy. And Beelzebub is the regent of this hunger.

At the beginning of the contamination, the hole, which we can
technically call FA (Open Source), does not cause many tribulations.
Quite the opposite. When the demons find their passage through the skin
and begin to sensitize it to form the source, the first contact with the
vital energy, now freely flowing through space, is pleasurable for a few
months. It's like a release of pressure. But this pleasure and
well-being are illusory. The simple fact is that demons naturally
possess an energetic structure favorable to the very constitution of
Astral Light. And this doesn't last more than two months.

Soon the Open Source expands, and the contamination begins to show its
effects. A "swarm" of demons, legions controlled by the lord of them
all, Beelzebub, gather around the same FA, compromising the entire
energetic, psychic, and physical field of the host.

The individual, now parasitized, becomes a banquet for the demons who
will drain their vital energy until, finally, the host dies.

Then you must be wondering how to know if you've been abducted and what
the symptoms of such spiritual contamination are?

Simple, it's your mood! Yes, your disposition. In ten cases of
depression, I can guarantee that eight of them involve contaminations
related to the draining of your vital energy. Often, the individual, the
host, is so exhausted that their depressive state at that moment is no
longer favorable for the demonic banquet and ends up leading them to the
brink of suicide. The annihilation of their existence in time.

Thus, we can conclude that the depressive state of our days, winter
depression, hyperactivities, pseudo-neurological disorders, etc., are
nothing more than parasitic possessions, or demonic contamination. There
is no lasting depression. In many cases, we can say that what exists is
an opening called FA and a banquet of demons surrounding frantically at
the base of your spine, especially in the area corresponding to the
second chakra of the Kundalini, Svadhishthana. Pay attention to the
center of the hunger. And realize that what happens to you is an
obsession that, as a result, depresses you.

How to heal this parasitic-bruise situation, which is no less than
natural in our energetic field?

In the following way: first, you will perform the cauterization of the
Open Source (FA), and then you will make the pact with your demon, the
creature of fire that will guide you through eternal neural eternity.

We live in a multidimensional existence. Life, this existence, is not
made only of the visible dimension. The more tuned your sensitive and
visual apparatus of your mind, your cerebral machine, the better you
will perceive the other dimensions, the demonic plane, the paradisiacal,
the invisible corresponding to the seven worlds, the seven astral
dimensions. This cauterization is extremely effective and must be done
with the Ionic Bath Ritual presented earlier in this book that you hold
in your hands.

As for the pact, refrain from the superstitious character of this word,
the manipulative and vulgar character of this term. Like many other
terminologies, the demonic pact has been hijacked by Machiavellian
institutions, especially the Roman Apostolic Church, which, having an
agenda of its own interests, demonized this method as well as usurped
the original meaning of the word demon, whose root is nothing more than
the Greek *demon*, which is your guardian spirit and inspirer, that is,
your vital dynamic.

I quote the words of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche
regarding the pact: "Beware of the demon you exorcize; it may be
throwing out the best of you!" The pact, this universal union made after
the cauterization of the opening of the energetic source, is of extreme
importance for the joint work between our dimensions.

These beings, the demons, more properly called the Children of the
Serpent, having Gaap as their messenger, use symbolic, magical devices
to increase their symbolic tuning and communicate on the screen of our
mental economy (through image and action) with the object of their
desires. That is, the human part of their energetic or spiritual
dimension.

I also present in this book a main pact that, when fulfilled, will guide
the aspirant, healed and in communion with the children of Cain, towards
their multidimensional union in a life of love and strength, creativity,
and success. Always moving forward and accepting passively as an
observer of the game of existence the cruel and dynamic beauty of their
own film on this planet, their own destiny, their own karma, their
unique life.

****Burning in Glamour****

Individuals who do not accept their demons, their role, are most often,
through the parasitism of the Open Source, destroyed by them. Because
here in the natural dimension, in the plane called visible reality,
everything is appearance, and even seemingly an organism without
function, which is not committed to its great work on earth, or more
than that, no matter how simple or vulgar it may be, committed to its
own history, for the sake of the completeness of its action, for the
sake of the collective energy, if it does not fulfill its function, it
is of no use.

It is naturally erased with a single blow because it needs to be
replaced.

Thus, death is merely a change of cloak because in its divine
enchantment is here the Serpent who instructs us on the exchange, on
love, and the explosion that pierces the luminous rainbow reflecting on
the flesh of life.

And even if you vanish, intoxicated and covered by the responsible will
of all your desires, you do not desire only for yourself. We are not
alone. Understand. Elements mix. Dimensions complete each other. The
Universe is the darkness, which now, before the light, rediscovers
itself.

Hail Gaap, Hail Lucifer. Satan! Belial.\
Baphomet;

**INVERSE FO EHT TERCES**

****The language of the sentinels and communicating demons (ministered
by Mercury — under the auspices of Mars and Jupiter) corresponds to
that which appears on the mental screen of those who hear them and share
their secrets. Both demons and angels are beings of the same descent.
Cornucopias of one and the same original flame. Energies whose essence
comes from a core the size of a tiny seed, in the orbit of a magnetic
field, vibrating in the fourth astral dimension. They are spheres whose
incessant luminosity reflects what we call the invisible. Hecate Mother,
Beelzebub, Gabriel, Belial, Michael, Satan, are dynamics, demons,
conjectures, gods, what has existed and will always exist in the
Universe and in you; because being part of this amalgam, this universal
whole, these energies also exist within you. Therefore, being aware of
the methods of access to these energies and the frequency required for
such communication, contact with these beings will be immediate.
Infallible. This is the function of a pact. Every pact has its
grammatical apparatus. Its unconditional vibration. Its magic of
ambiguous powers but never random. Its frequency and regular station.
Spring-like in origin. Use your imagination and your creativity, but
never without first recognizing the efficacy of the most varied methods
in your favor. The human brain is an electromagnetic mesh, possessing an
atomic power unparalleled, and many times, due to simple habits arising
from superstitious and cowardly fear, it is little explored. But before
the brain, this magnificent device that marks the ages and evolutionary
battles, before it is the conscious spirit of its origin that operates
it, and it is the spirit that has access to the codes of all stations.
Therefore, keep with you this secret revealed at the peak of the highest
vertex. Keep it in your sharpened heart, in introspective silence,
eternal or aberrant. The secret of fire and the renewed metamorphosis of
all Serpents. Behold;****

****To Gaap. The Serpent-Magician Man,\
my master, my life and vital force.\
For all. Enter.****

****END. REVELATION\
On the Clavicle\
And the First Grimoires****

The earliest Grimoires (grammars) were magical formulas intended to
subjugate the natural elements—primarily those dwelling within
infernal, luciferian dimensions, enshrouded in their Qliphothic shells.
These enchantments functioned as traps, lures, drawing
demons—seemingly subdued—into servitude for those who dared summon
them in rites of domination.

The most well-known grimoire, and a fitting example, is the *Clavicula
Salomonis*, or *Ars Goetia*, which details the ritualistic evocation of
the seventy-two infernal princes. However, one must not overlook another
crucial grimoire, known as *The Book of Abramelin*. Supposedly written
in the Middle Ages by the Jewish sage Abraham the Wise.

****The error imparted by the authors of these grammars lies, first and
foremost, in their surrender to superstition—allowing such beliefs to
corrupt their relationship with the invisible plane. Faith, or the
religious posture of each practitioner, whether rooted in fear or
superstition, embalms the act of magical operation, thereby compromising
both its magnetism and the integrity of its purity (with regard to the
method applied to such invocations).****

****Though their intent may have been functional, it remains obscured.
Either they were Christians who believed that by cloaking black magic in
a pseudo-angelic guise they might be spared demonic dominion, or they
sought to draw demons into our dimension in service of their own selfish
whims—almost as if staging a circus spectacle.****

****I point out their error. Follow this reasoning with me: what fallen
angel, possessor of pre-human, antediluvian wisdom, would allow itself
to be subdued by enchantments that, a priori, would have to be tested
repeatedly before being refined to true efficacy? And if, by some means,
they were indeed subdued—what demons would willingly operate through
gateways into our world without first gifting their oppressor the very
mirror of his own intent—subjugation?****

****None.\****

****These dimensional portals are breaches of varying proportions,
depending on the symbolic economy applied to them. And I can assure you:
even the smallest sigil, the slightest of these gates, emits a
luminosity through which a demon—being the target of an invocation and
its corresponding signature (the symbol)—can clearly draw forth
another Mephistophelian entity that lingers nearby, abducting the
supposedly \"safe\" magician from his practice while sealing pacts with
his own ego.****

****I do not claim these grimoires to be forgeries. No, they are not.
But the method by which they are employed is not only extremely
dangerous, it also no longer corresponds to the present age nor to the
true nature of our lineage.****

****We do not enslave. We work together — for harmony and for
strength, for wisdom and for the animal delight of our kind.****

**::\**

**The book you hold in your hands (the one you have just finished
reading) was not written by me, as Myself. This grimoire was dictated to
me by Gaap— a fallen angel of the Order of Potentatus / of the
Infernal Principality—during the long nights of the Scandinavian
winter and the endless days of the Swedish summer — unusually dark in
the year it was revealed to me.\**

**Gaap, that majestic and powerful presence, reptilian in appearance,
clad in the mantle of night, mimicking the walk and gestures of men,
identifies himself in this summa as Gaap Do Val (the surname being a
contraction of the word** *Valley***).\**

**My first contact occurred on a certain night when I was awakened,
feeling a painful pressure at the base of my spine, by a nocturnal
traveler from these demonic dimensions, cloaked and masking his face
with the beak of a bird, reminiscent of a raven.\**

**I shall now attempt to describe his eyes in the best way I can, though
I am aware of the impossibility of such a task in portraying their
beauty. His eyes were like twin black stones, symmetrical— the heart
of the moon—something oriental. Moist in their darkness, reptilian,
for they bore a most delicate vertical slit, almost as if made by a
damp blade of paper, and within those lines ran a dark blood, as if they
were the pupils of an ancient, spring-born serpent.**

**Every night (around four in the morning), I offered myself to his
service and surrendered completely, without any superstitious
restraints—(for long now, orthodox or modern Christianity has served
me no purpose)—and thus I wrote down what was revealed to me with the
attentiveness of one holding a wondrous codex.\**

**And so I assure you: if there is anything human in this grimoire (and
obviously, human importance to these beings is vital), that something
lies solely in the use of this divine apparatus we call the body, and
this marvelous machine driven by intellect—the brain. For during the
months of crafting this book, both became the steed, the feathers of the
Devil's wings—of Lucifer, of all reptiles and winged angels—who
once, for our sake (for their love of our species), abandoned their
state of Grace and, through wisdom and desire, just like you and me,
went astray.\**

**Thus, oh my beloved brother, there is nothing left to do but to
understand this truth as the part of you that was once stolen—and
which I now return to you... as if it were... the very best of
yourself.**
